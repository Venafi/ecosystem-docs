<h1 id="writing-adaptable-drivers">Writing Adaptable Drivers</h1>
<p>Venafi Adaptable Drivers provide a way quick, easy framework to build integrations, primarily with target <strong>CAs</strong> (certificate authorities) and <strong>application platforms</strong> (web servers, network devices, application firewalls, etc.), but also to support flexible workflow and logging needs for unique environments.</p>
<p>Venafi Adaptable Drivers support Venafi TLS Protect Datacenter only. Venafi PM team is working on a similar framework for TLS Protect Cloud use cases. </p>

<h3 id="adaptable-framework-overview">Adaptable Framework Overview</h3>
<p>The following guidelines apply generally to all versions of the Adaptable Framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers rely on System.Management.Automation in .NET to invoke PowerShell functions inside a locally hosted script</li>
<li>PowerShell functions must not return errors; rather, they must throw exceptions in the same way that actual PowerShell errors do - the adaptable CA driver treats exceptions thrown by a PowerShell function as a fatal error and then halts processing</li>
<li>PowerShell functions are responsible for ensuring that data meets the requirements of the integration point</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h5>
<p>Venafi passes variables to (and receives them from) PowerShell functions in the form of hash tables, which are generally easier to work with and allows for the addition of variables without changing the function definition.</p>
<ul>
<li>A general hash table, which includes a common set of data available from Venafi, is passed to all the functions</li>
<li>A specific hash table, which includes data that is applicable only to the specific function, is passed to some functions that require additional data</li>
<li>All functions must return a single hash table that includes a result along with any other variables that the function is required to return</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h5>
<ul>
<li>PowerShell 3.0 or later</li>
<li>.NET 4.6.1 or later</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your product does not support TLS 1.3, you will need to add the following code to your Adaptable script in order for it to work with the Venafi Platform.
<code>[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="adaptable-framework-best-practices">Adaptable Framework Best Practices</h3>
<p>The following recommended best practices apply to all versions of the Adaptable Framework.</p>
<h5 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h5>
<p>To avoid collisions, you should adopt a standard naming convention that will be used when creating objects (certificates, devices, applications) in Venafi. Collisions can occur when the name you define already exists in Venafi's inventory. You can use the same prefix or suffix, and then add something unique to the name.</p>
<p>Suppose your driver connects to a <strong>device object</strong> via API and imports all the machine identities currently in use on the device. In addition to the certificates themselves being imported, a unique <strong>application object</strong> must be created as well, which will contain all the metadata (port, partition, profile, configuration options, etc.) needed for Venafi to automatically provision that certificate during a renewal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When creating new PowerShell scripts for use with adaptable drivers, keep in mind that the file name is used to identify your script from within the associated object (and within the policy for the Adaptable Application driver) in Trust Protection Platform. Using logical names can help you and other administrators recognize the purpose and intent of each script.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="credentials-authentication">Credentials &amp; Authentication</h5>
<p><strong>Credential objects</strong> store the credentials Trust Protection Platform uses to authenticate with devices, applications, CAs, and Active Directory user directories. The stored credential may be a password, a username and password, a certificate, a file paired with a password, or a private key. Trust Protection Platform requires these credentials so it can manage the certificates associated with these devices, applications, and CAs. </p>
<p>Credential objects provide an innovative way to centrally manage and share your system credentials. Each credential object can be associated with a single device or application, or it can be shared by multiple objects. </p>
<p>After you create your system’s credential objects, you do not have to repeat the credential configuration for each device or application. You simply reference the existing credential object. If the credential changes—for example, an organization might change username and password credentials every 90 days—you merely update the single credential object to give Trust Protection Platform access to all associated devices and applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reuse credential objects wherever standardization is possible to avoid creating extraneous objects.</li>
<li>Recommend assigning credentials to a Policy folder that contains multiple devices. The policy credentials allow multiple devices to use the same credential.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="certificate-installations">Certificate "Installations"</h5>
<p>Within a customer’s environment, there may be circumstances that require the same certificate to be installed in multiple locations (high-availability, load balancing, etc.). If that is the case, the Venafi platform needs to be made aware of each location. This ensures there are no blind spots for the Security or PKI team, and also provides Venafi the information necessary to automatically provision and activate that certificate during renewal operations.</p>
<p>It is critical if your application supports multiple installations of the same certificate, that ALL of those locations be reported back to Venafi.</p>
<h5 id="data-validation">Data Validation</h5>
<p>You should implement effective data validation in order to catch errors in the script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check values for validity that are being passed into functions</li>
<li>Check values for validity before passing data back to Venafi</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="logging">Logging</h5>
<p>Generally, Adaptable Framework scripts don’t need to do any logging unless it’s for temporary, debugging purposes. The Adaptable drivers are logging to the standard Venafi logging channel when they call various PowerShell functions.</p>
<p>Starting in TPP 19.3, developers can toggle debug logging for individual Adaptable drivers. This sets a $DEBUG_FILE global variable in the Adaptable driver. If toggled on, the script should be logging – If toggled off, it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The $DEBUG_FILE variable gets set automatically to a suggested file path on the Venafi server for the script to write logs to, using a unique identifier. This is to avoid issues if there are multiple instances trying to write data to the same file.</p>
<ul>
<li>If additional, permanent logs are needed, use Write-EventLog to capture important logging and debug information to the Windows Event Log</li>
<li>Throw exceptions back to Venafi<ul>
<li>Write effective error messages that tell users what went wrong and how to fix the issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="general-tips">General Tips</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, certificates should be referenced using the GUID of the <em>certificate object</em></li>
<li>Listing all certificates in a folder could be problematic because there may be a very high number of certificates in some policy folders. A better approach would be to check (search) whether a specific certificate already exists within a given policy folder. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adaptable-types">Adaptable Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Adaptable CA Driver</a>: Choose this if you are building an integration between Venafi and a Machine Identity <strong><em>Producer</em></strong>, like a Certificate Authority or Managed PKI.</li>
<li><a href="">Adaptable Application Driver</a>: Choose this if you are building an integration between Venafi and a Machine Identity <strong><em>Consumer</em></strong>, like an application server, network device, WAF, etc.</li>
<li><a href="">Adaptable Log Driver</a>: Choose this if you are building a solution that will be used to perform virtually any programmatic task in response to the logging of a Venafi event. </li>
