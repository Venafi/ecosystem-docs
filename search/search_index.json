Venafi Adaptable Drivers support Venafi TLS Protect Datacenter only. Venafi PM team is working on a similar framework for TLS Protect Cloud use cases. Please sign up here to be notified when developer tools are available for TLS Protect Cloud. High-Level Order of Operations \u00b6 Read this doc (You're here!) Decide which DevKit you'll need Build & test your driver using the tools provided in the DevKit Test your driver against TLS Protect Datacenter Submit your driver to Cool Solutions (Venafi's managed GitLab instance) Complete the Marketplace Listing Questionnaire Adaptable Framework Overview \u00b6 The following guidelines apply generally to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Drivers rely on System.Management.Automation in .NET to invoke PowerShell functions inside a locally hosted script PowerShell functions must not return errors; rather, they must throw exceptions in the same way that actual PowerShell errors do - the adaptable CA driver treats exceptions thrown by a PowerShell function as a fatal error and then halts processing PowerShell functions are responsible for ensuring that data meets the requirements of the integration point Hash Tables \u00b6 Venafi passes variables to (and receives them from) PowerShell functions in the form of hash tables, which are generally easier to work with and allows for the addition of variables without changing the function definition. A general hash table, which includes a common set of data available from Venafi, is passed to all the functions A specific hash table, which includes data that is applicable only to the specific function, is passed to some functions that require additional data All functions must return a single hash table that includes a result along with any other variables that the function is required to return Minimum Requirements \u00b6 PowerShell 3.0 or later .NET 4.6.1 or later NOTE: If your product does not support TLS 1.3, you will need to add the following code to your Adaptable script in order for it to work with the Venafi Platform. [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Adaptable Framework Best Practices \u00b6 The following recommended best practices apply to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Naming Conventions \u00b6 To avoid collisions, you should adopt a standard naming convention that will be used when creating objects (certificates, devices, applications) in Venafi. Collisions can occur when the name you define already exists in Venafi's inventory. You can use the same prefix or suffix, and then add something unique to the name. Suppose your driver connects to a device object via API and imports all the machine identities currently in use on the device. In addition to the certificates themselves being imported, a unique application object must be created as well, which will contain all the metadata (port, partition, profile, configuration options, etc.) needed for Venafi to automatically provision that certificate during a renewal. NOTE: When creating new PowerShell scripts for use with adaptable drivers, keep in mind that the file name is used to identify your script from within the associated object (and within the policy for the Adaptable Application driver) in Trust Protection Platform. Using logical names can help you and other administrators recognize the purpose and intent of each script. Credentials & Authentication \u00b6 Credential objects store the credentials Trust Protection Platform uses to authenticate with devices, applications, CAs, and Active Directory user directories. The stored credential may be a password, a username and password, a certificate, a file paired with a password, or a private key. Trust Protection Platform requires these credentials so it can manage the certificates associated with these devices, applications, and CAs. Credential objects provide an innovative way to centrally manage and share your system credentials. Each credential object can be associated with a single device or application, or it can be shared by multiple objects. After you create your system\u2019s credential objects, you do not have to repeat the credential configuration for each device or application. You simply reference the existing credential object. If the credential changes\u2014for example, an organization might change username and password credentials every 90 days\u2014you merely update the single credential object to give Trust Protection Platform access to all associated devices and applications. Reuse credential objects wherever standardization is possible to avoid creating extraneous objects. Recommend assigning credentials to a Policy folder that contains multiple devices. The policy credentials allow multiple devices to use the same credential. Certificate \"Installations\" \u00b6 Within a customer\u2019s environment, there may be circumstances that require the same certificate to be installed in multiple locations (high-availability, load balancing, etc.). If that is the case, the Venafi platform needs to be made aware of each location. This ensures there are no blind spots for the Security or PKI team, and also provides Venafi the information necessary to automatically provision and activate that certificate during renewal operations. It is critical if your application supports multiple installations of the same certificate, that ALL of those locations be reported back to Venafi. Data Validation \u00b6 You should implement effective data validation in order to catch errors in the script: Check values for validity that are being passed into functions Check values for validity before passing data back to Venafi Logging \u00b6 Generally, Adaptable Framework scripts don\u2019t need to do any logging unless it\u2019s for temporary, debugging purposes. The Adaptable drivers are logging to the standard Venafi logging channel when they call various PowerShell functions. Starting in TPP 19.3, developers can toggle debug logging for individual Adaptable drivers. This sets a $DEBUG_FILE global variable in the Adaptable driver. If toggled on, the script should be logging \u2013 If toggled off, it shouldn\u2019t. The $DEBUG_FILE variable gets set automatically to a suggested file path on the Venafi server for the script to write logs to, using a unique identifier. This is to avoid issues if there are multiple instances trying to write data to the same file. If additional, permanent logs are needed, use Write-EventLog to capture important logging and debug information to the Windows Event Log Throw exceptions back to Venafi Write effective error messages that tell users what went wrong and how to fix the issue General Tips \u00b6 Ideally, certificates should be referenced using the GUID of the certificate object Listing all certificates in a folder could be problematic because there may be a very high number of certificates in some policy folders. A better approach would be to check (search) whether a specific certificate already exists within a given policy folder.

In fact, after certificates are added to the certificate inventory, Venafi as a Service validates them automatically (every 24 hours). Why is certificate validation important? Because security, compliance, and technological innovations introduce new criteria for the validation of certificates and the servers that host them, Venafi as a Service uses validation techniques to ensure that your certificates remain valid and are being used properly. Venafi as a Service warns you automatically about any certificates that fail validation. In addition, a Machine Identity Digest is sent out through email notifications to specified recipients so that they can take immediate action. In addition to validating certificates automatically, you can also run validation on certificates manually using Validate Now . And Validate Now can also sniff out any additional installations of certificates in your inventory. Types of certificate validations \u00b6 Venafi as a Service supports two types of certificate validation: SSL/TLS validation Certificate chain validation About SSL/TLS validation \u00b6 The validation feature in Venafi as a Service performs an SSL/TLS validation on each certificate every 24 hours, or you can run a validation manually at any time. The SSL/TLS validation checks that the correct certificate is in use on an application, and that the certificate is properly configured. Validation Status Description Risk level Resolution Hostname mismatch The TLS target presented a certificate, but the common name or SAN of your SSL/TLS certificate does not match the domain where the certificate is installed High Install the correct version of the certificate associated with the domain. Or reissue a certificate by verifying the CN and SAN. Old version of certificate found One of the certificate installations is using older versions of certificates that should be replaced with the newer versions. High Install current version of the certificate on the target TLS server installation. No certificate present TLS target specificed in the VaaS platform didn't present a certificate on a specified port Warning Verify TLS server installation and port number and ensure if the target is valid. If target is valid, investigate why certificate is not present. If the target is no longer valid, remove target from discovery target list or Alternatively, the user just needs to wait until the installation is aged out. Current installation aged out time is 30 days. Unexpected certificate found Certificate found on the TLS target contains a different fingerprint than the one that Venafi as a Service expected. Warning Install the correct certificate on the endpoint. Unknown error Venafi as a Service encountered an error but could not identify it. Warning When an unknown error occurs, Venafi as a Service automatically captures the details of the condition and submits it to Venafi for future enhancement. If you have additional questions, contact Venafi Support . Pending The validation process has not yet occurred. Warning When this occurs, try running a manual validation (Validate Now) or waiting until the next automated validation occurs. If you have additional questions, contact Venafi Support . About certificate chain validation \u00b6 Each certificate in Venafi as a Service shows that certificate's chain. A certificate chain starts with the end-entity certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate. Root certificates are typically issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), but you can upload additional root certificates if needed, such as for an internal CA. Certificate chain validation makes sure a given certificate chain is well-formed, valid, properly signed, and trustworthy. Any error in the certificate chain could cause an outage. To help avoid chain-related outages, Venafi as a Service continuously monitors all certificates in the chain. What is a certificate chain? If you are unfamiliar with certificate chains, read through How do Certificate Chains Work for background. Following are the possible certificate chain validation states, their descriptions, and resolution actions. Validation Status Description Risk level Resolution Chain expiring soon One or more of the CA certificates in the trust chain expires before the end-entity does, or is expiring soon. High Identify the expiring or about to expire CA certificate from end entity certificate, download and install the current chain. If the current chain is not available, renew the certificate, download and install end-entity and chain certificates. Chain building failed One or more intermediate or root CA certificates is missing, and a complete chain can't be constructed. This means VC can build the chain for the certificate independent of the CA certificates returned by the server. Warning Install the missing intermediate CA certificate(s) on the TLS server target. Incomplete chain The chain returned by the endpoint did not include a sufficient number of valid intermediate certificates to build a complete chain anchored by a root CA. If you miss installing the intermediate certificate or upload the wrong one, then it can not be chained back and the browsers will not trust the certificate and may generate a broken chain or similar sort of warnings. Warning Check if your intermediate certificate is invalid due to revocation or expiration. Download and install your end entity certificate along with proper intermediate certificate(s) that form its trust chain. Chain not trusted The chain returned by the target cannot be used to form a Trusted chain Warning Add the missing CA certificate to the Trusted CA Certificate inventory Unknown error Venafi as a Service encountered an error but could not identify it. Warning When an unknown error occurs, Venafi as a Service automatically captures the details of the condition and submits it to Venafi for future enhancement. If you have additional questions, contact Venafi Support . Pending The validation process has not yet occurred. Warning When this occurs, try running a manual validation (Validate Now) or waiting until the next automated validation occurs. If you have additional questions, contact Venafi Support .

In fact, after certificates are added to the certificate inventory, Venafi as a Service validates them automatically (every 24 hours). Why is certificate validation important? Because security, compliance, and technological innovations introduce new criteria for the validation of certificates and the servers that host them, Venafi as a Service uses validation techniques to ensure that your certificates remain valid and are being used properly. Venafi as a Service warns you automatically about any certificates that fail validation. In addition, a Machine Identity Digest is sent out through email notifications to specified recipients so that they can take immediate action. In addition to validating certificates automatically, you can also run validation on certificates manually using Validate Now .

Applications are bundles of software that make up your site\u2019s back end, from the operating system and web servers to APIs and programming frameworks. Each component provides a layer for their compatibility, and bundling them makes them easier to download and deploy all at once. The components of an Application can range from the general (an operating system) through to the specific (a particular PHP framework). Did you know? The people who create and configure applications are typically Resource Owners. In the menu bar, click Organization > Applications . Click New . In Add an Application , do the following: Enter an Application Name for your new application. (Optional) Enter a Description , which can be helpful to other users and teams who might need to know the purpose of your application. Select Application Owners , which can be both individual users or teams. Select one more more Certificate Issuing Templates . For Automated Secure Keypair To use Automated Secure Keypair , the template that you select must have a Key Pair Generation of either Venafi or user generate key pair or Venafi generated key pair .

Before you begin \u00b6 Have the following ready before you start: Linux server to run VSatellite. See Pre-requisites for installing VSatellites for a list of system and network requirements. Windows server to run VSatellite Worker. The server must meet the following minimum requirements: Separate server from the server running AD CS Windows Server 2019 Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.0 or higher Access to ports 135 and 49152 - 65535 on AD CS Service VSatellite connectivity to the VSatellite Worker - port 8085 (default) or the custom port specified during VSatellite Worker installation 4 GB RAM 2 CPUs 300 MB free disk space (before Worker install) Completed AD CS configuration IP or hostname of your Microsoft AD CS server Username and password used to authenticate to Microsoft AD CS Microsoft AD CS Issuing Certificate Common Name Step 1: Connect your AD CS server to Venafi as a Service \u00b6 First, we'll set up the connection between your Microsoft AD CS server and Venafi as a Service. If you don't already have a VSatellite or VSatellite Worker, these steps will walk you through those installations. If you do, then you can just select them during setup. Sign to Venafi as a Service at https://ui.venafi.cloud . Click Settings > Certificate Authorities . Click New > Microsoft AD CS . Enter a Name for the Certificate Authority. Tip This is the name that will be used throughout Venafi as a Service for this CA. From the VSatellite Worker drop-down, select the VSatellite Worker to use in this configuration. If you don't have a VSatellite Worker yet, click the box below for instructions on setting one up. Don't have a VSatellite Worker yet? Follow these steps to set one up. Important The VSatellite Worker must not be installed on the same server running AD CS. Click Deploy VSatellite Worker . If you're installing the VSatellite Worker on a Windows server that has internet access, select \"Online Installation.\" If the Server does not have internet access, select \"Offline Installation.\" Online Installation Offline Installation Copy the VSatellite Worker installation command , and then run the script in a PowerShell prompt on the Windows server where you're setting up your VSatellite Worker. To use a port other than the default port 8085, replace the port number following the --port flag before running the installation command. Copy the VSatellite Worker download command , and run it in a PowerShell prompt from a machine with internet connectivity. This downloads the VSatellite Worker installer ( VSatelliteWorkerInstaller.msi ) and VSatellite Worker ( vsatworkectl.exe ). Move both files to the same directory on the Windows server you want to install VSatellite Worker on. After moving the files, copy the VSatellite Worker installation command , and then run the script in a PowerShell prompt on the Windows server you're setting up as your VSatellite Worker. To use a port other than the default port 8085, replace the port number following the --port flag before running the installation command. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation. Check if the VSatellite Worker service is running on the Windows server by going to the Start menu and typing Services . From there, open the Services app, and in the Name column, look for VSatWorkerService . After the VSatellite Worker is up and running, return to the Venafi as a Service screen, and click Continue . In the VSatellite Worker server address , enter the FQDN or IP address of the Windows server where you installed the VSatellite Worker. Include the port number. The default port is 8085 , but if you set a different port during installation, enter that port instead. Click Set . To complete the setup, the VSatellite Worker needs to be paired with a VSatellite. If you already have a VSatellite in place, you can select it from the VSatellite drop-down. If you need to set up a VSatellite, see the section below. Do you also need to set up a VSatellite? Follow these steps A VSatellite Worker needs to be paired with a VSatellite in order to communicate with Venafi as a Service. Click Deploy VSatellite . The Deploy a VSatellite page opens. From the VSatellite deployment script , click Copy Code to copy the entire command. Run the command on the Linux server you've set up to be your VSatellite. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Note The installation may take up to 10 minutes. After installation, return to the Deploy a VSatellite screen in Venafi as a Service, and click Test Connection . Note Activating the VSatellite takes a few seconds. If Test Connection fails initially, click the button again to re-test the connection until it succeeds, and the Done button at the bottom of the screen is enabled. Click Done . You are returned to the Deploy VSatellite Worker page. The VSatellite drop-down should now show the VSatellite you just deployed. Click Pair to connect the VSatellite Worker to the VSatellite. Click Done . You are returned to the Connection page, and the VSatellite Worker drop-down is populated with the VSatellite Worker you just set up. Click Next . Step 2: Enter your AD CS information \u00b6 Next, we'll enter your Microsoft AD CS server information and credentials so that Venafi as a Service can authenticate to your AD CS server. In the AD CS administrative address field, enter the IP address or hostname of your Microsoft AD CS server. In the Common Name (CN) of the CA's certificate box, enter the Common Name of the Microsoft AD CS Issuing (root) Certificate. Enter the Username and Password to authenticate with Microsoft AD CS. AD CS Permissions The account you use must have Read , Issue and Manage Certificates , and Request Certificates permissions to the Microsoft AD CS server. Click Test credentials . Step 3: Select AD CS issuance templates to map to Venafi as a Service \u00b6 Now that the connection is made, we can set up certificate issuance through Venafi as a Service. This step is required only if you want to issue new TLS server authentication certificates through Venafi as a Service. If you just want to import existing certificates, see the import existing certificates steps below. Click in the Issuance templates field. After clicking in the field, Venafi as a Service queries your AD CS and returns a list of issuance templates from your AD CS server. Select the AD CS issuance templates that you want to map to Venafi as a Service. Click Add . Venafi as a Service tests all the templates you selected. Templates with a Passed result are available to map to Certificate Issuing Templates in Venafi as a Service. Those with a Failed result are not. Why did some templates fail? After adding templates, Venafi as a Service issues test certificates using each of the AD CS issuance templates. Venafi as a Service supports issuance through templates that: Have Server Authentication set in the Application Policies setting of the Extensions tab on the issuance template Allow issuing certificates using RSA keys Supply the Subject Name in the request (can\u2019t issue certificates with SN build from the AD) Issuance templates that are incapable of issuing such certificates fail the Venafi as a Service issuance test. This is expected. Some of the predefined (default) Issuance templates that will fail are: DirectoryEmailReplication DomainController DomainControllerAuthentication KerberosAuthentication Only the certificates that pass the test will be available when mapping AD CS templates to Venafi as a Service templates. Click Next . On the Statistics tab of your Microsoft AD CS certificate authority, you see a summary of your certificates. Click on any number to open a pre-filtered Certificate Inventory page to see those certificates. What's Next? Now that your AD CS templates are mapped to Venafi as a Service, you can create a Certificate Issuing Template and associate your AD CS templates with Venafi as a Service issuing templates. Select Microsoft from the New Certificate Issuing template screen. The AD CS templates that passed validation will show up in the Product Option drop-down. Step 4: Import existing certificates from AD CS \u00b6 This step is required only if you want to import existing certificates from AD CS. Click in the Import templates box. After clicking in the box, Venafi as a Service queries your AD CS and returns a list of templates from your AD CS server. Select the AD CS templates that you want to import certificates from. Only certificates issued by the templates you select will be imported. Click Add . If you want to schedule the import to occur on a regular basis, click the AD CS Import slider, and then set the import interval. This option is available only if one or more AD CS templates were added in the previous steps. Under Import options , select whether you want to import revoked or expired certificates. Click Done . Venafi as a Service imports the certificates. On the Statistics tab of your Microsoft AD CS certificate authority, you see a summary of your certificates.

Scanafi is a lightweight command line tool that enables you to scan hosts on your internal network for SSL/TLS certificates. Scanafi is available as a single executable file for Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. Scanafi performs network discoveries for certificates on port 443 and additional well-known ports via SSL/TLS and STARTTLS handshakes. This utility tests for the presence of known vulnerabilities such as DROWN, Heartbleed, logjam, poodle, and poodle TLS. The primary mode of operation involves sending certificate discovery results to the Venafi as a Service Platform over REST API. This communication is over HTTPS TCP Port 443. Scanafi can operate in two simple modes: online or offline. Online mode The online mode involves the automatic transmission of certificate discovery results to the VaaS instance specified in the API call portion of the command line operation. For online mode with VaaS, communication is over HTTPS and authentication credentials (an API token) for Venafi as a Service are also required. You can get an API token after successful registration on VaaS. Offline mode Scanafi is capable of operating in a offline mode. In this mode, all certificate discovery results are logged to a standard text file, in JSON format.

If it's running in online mode, Scanafi should also have Internet access to upload results to the appropriate instance of VaaS. Click Download next to the appropriate operating system. Save the file, then run it. Next step: Configure and copy the Scanafi command line Deployment strategies Scanafi is deployed as an executable file and requires no installation on the target host. It does not receive commands or perform work from a centralized platform. Scans that are performed are simply passed as command arguments to the executable. While it is possible to execute scans manually by copying the executable to a host and executing Scanafi, it is assumed that in most enterprise organizations a more automated management process would be desired. A typical strategy is to identify hosts within network segments to host the Scanafi executable and configure scheduled tasks and/or cron jobs to routinely execute the discovery process. Another strategy would be to use existing system management frameworks (i.e. BigFix, Tanium, Puppet, Chef, and Microsoft SCCM) already in place to manage, patch, and configure systems in the environment to automatically deploy Scanafi. Discovery would be executed, then Scanafi would automatically be removed after completion. Automated Result Processing \u00b6 The typical approach is for Scanafi to be configured to execute on a host within the target network segment and upon completion of the scan, send the results directly to Venafi as a Service using the WebSDK API. This approach simplifies any additional work required to process result files in order to gain visibility through Venafi as a Service. Standalone Result File Processing \u00b6 Another approach is to deploy Scanafi to a host within the targeted network segment and execute it with parameters intended to scan the local subnet then output results to a JSON file. Upon completion, the results file can be sent to a central location for import into Venafi as a Service using the WebSDK API.

Scanafi is available as a single executable file for Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems. Scanafi performs certificate discoveries on port 443 and additional well-known ports via SSL/TLS and STARTTLS handshakes. It also tests for the presence of known vulnerabilities such as DROWN, Heartbleed, logjam, poodle, and poodle TLS. The primary mode of operation involves sending certificate discovery results to the Venafi as a Service Platform over REST API. This communication is over HTTPS TCP Port 443. Scanafi can operate in two simple modes: online or offline. The online mode involves the automatic transmission of certificate discovery results to the Venafi as a Service instance specified in the API call portion of the command line operation. Communication is over HTTPS and authentication credentials (an API token) for Venafi as a Service are also required. You can get an API token after successful registration on Venafi as a Service.

VSatellites extend the reach of your Venafi as a Service account beyond publicly accessible networks and hosts, to your on-premise/private cloud networks and machines, enabling you to develop the full picture of your machine identities across your organization, irrespective of public or private visibility. At the most basic level, VSatellite is a self-updating application that is a runtime extension of Venafi as a Service that runs within your private infrastructure. VSatellite is a modern, self-contained, low-footprint, Kubernetes-based application runtime and runs on popular Linux systems. You manage your own VSatellites remotely using your company's own Venafi as a Service account. So, after your administrators have completed a one-time download and setup of VSatellites on your designated machines (Linux), full administration and management of services for those VSatellites is performed from using the Venafi as a Service web console. This includes self-updates of the VSatellite runtime itself. Learn more about managing your existing VSatellites .

If you've not yet created the machine to which you want to provision the certificate, start there first . Otherwise, follow the steps below. Before you begin \u00b6 The certificate you want to provision should already be in the Venafi as a Service certificate inventory and requested using Automated Secure Keypair . The machine should already be created in Venafi as a Service. F5 BIG-IP LTM \u00b6 You can provision a certificate to an existing SSL profile on your F5, or you can use Venafi as a Service to create a new SSL profile for you. The steps below walk you through both scenarios. In the Venafi as a Service toolbar, click Machines . The Machines list opens. Click the checkbox next to the F5 BIG-IP LTM machine that you want to provision a certificate to. Click Provision a certificate . From the Choose a certificate from the inventory field, begin typing the certificate name you want to provision. Click the certificate when you see it listed. Verify that you've selected the correct certificate by reviewing the subject DN, validity, and fingerprint. In Certificate Name , enter the name for this certificate as you want it to appear on your F5. What if the name is already in use on the F5? When provisioning a certificate to the F5, Venafi as a Service checks to see if the name you enter in this field is already in use. If the name you enter isn't in use, Venafi as a Service will use it. If the name is in use, Venafi as a Service checks to see if it's the same certificate. If so, Venafi as a Service uses the certificate that is already on the F5. If the name is in use, but it's a different certificate, then Venafi as a Service creates a new certificate. A unique certificate name will be generated using a combination of the certificate name entered in this field, the expiration date from the certificate, and a unique numerical value, such as my-cert-name_22Oct05_3117 . In Chain Bundle Name , enter the name for the CA certificate bundle as you want it to appear on your F5. Note The bundle name must not exist or must already contain the chain CA certificates and may contain other certificates. From the Profile Type drop-down, select either Client SSL Profile or Server SSL Profile , depending on the type of F5 profile you're provisioning to. In the Partition field, enter an F5 partition name. This partition must already exist on the F5. Leaving this field blank will default to the F5's Common partition. Note The partition name is case sensitive. In the Parent Profile field, enter the name of the parent profile you want to associate with the SSL Profile. Note If you're using an existing SSL Profile in the next step, this field will be ignored. Venafi as a Service will not modify the parent profile of existing SSL profiles. In the SSL Profile field, enter an SSL profile name. This can be either a name that is already in use on the F5 partition, or a new name. What happens if the name is already in use? If the profile name you enter already exists in the F5 partition you entered previously (see step 8 above), then Venafi as a Service will provision the certificate to that profile.

You can integrate Venafi as a Service with Auth0 to enable single sign-on (SSO) for user identities with which Auth0 can proxy. Auth0 is a flexible solution you can use to add authentication and authorization services to Venafi as a Service. Auth0 administrators can configure connections to various identity providers. These can include social connections such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, and LinkedIn, or enterprise connections such as SAML, OpenID Connect, Ping, Google G Suite, and so on. Alternatively, you could even use your own database. There are a number of options for you to choose from. TIP Because you'll be making changes in both the Auth0 portal and Venafi as a Service, you'll complete the configuration faster if you open both user interfaces side-by-side before proceeding. To set up this integration, you'll need to Configure Auth0 and Venafi as a Service to work together Test the connection between Venafi as a Service and Auth0 (Conditional) Add an additional rule to Auth0, if needed Configuring Auth0 and Venafi as a Service to work together Log in to your Auth0 account and click Applications . You'll notice that a default application is created for you already. Click Create Application . On the Create application page, type a name for the application (e.g. Venafi as a Service ), click Regular Web Application , and then click Create . TIP You can change the name of the application any time. More about this step Once the application is created, some information is filled in automatically. For example, notice that in the following image, the domain is your OIDC Issuer URL, the Client ID is the ID that represents your application, and the Client Secret is the secret that is required for configuring the option to sign in. From the Settings tab, under Basic information , copy the Domain , Client ID and Client Secret and paste them into a temporary file; these values are required later on when you configure SSO in Venafi as a Service. TIP Note that the redirect URI is sometimes referred to as the callback URI . You can have multiple callback (redirect) URI's. (Optional) You can download this logo file and select it from the Application Logo field if you plan on making the application visible to users on the Auth0 portal page: Log in to Venafi as a Service and go to the SSO configuration page (Venafi as a Service > Settings > Venafi as a Service Platform > Single Sign On > Configuration) and paste the values you got from the previous step into ClientId , Secret and Issuer URL . NOTE The Domain value (which you copied earlier) must be used in order to provide a correct OIDC Issuer URL. Refer to the earlier example screenshot of Domain in the Auth0 Application Settings tab. To ensure that it is properly recognized, the URL should be https:// domain from Auth0 /. If the issuer URL is configured incorrectly, you'll see an error indicating that the issuer URL does not match. Next to Redirect URL , click to copy the redirect URL, and then in Auth0 , on the Application Properties page, scroll down and paste the redirect URL into Allowed Callback URLs . The redirect URL is important because after the login process is complete, Auth0 must know where to send (redirect) users who've successfully logged in. Save your changes in Auth0 . You are now done configuring the Venafi as a Service application in Auth0. The next step is to test your connection. Testing the connection between Venafi as a Service and Auth0 From the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page, click Test connection . When prompted by Auth0 , type your enterprise credentials. When the authentication succeeds, you're redirected back to the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page. From there, you can view the claims that were returned in the OIDC token issued by Auth0. Save your SSO configuration. (Conditional) Add an additional rule to Auth0, if needed Venafi as a Service requires that the standard claims of first name and last name are included as part of the user context in the token. Depending on your configuration of Auth0, you might have to add an additional rule to ensure that the standard claims are part of the user context. In almost all cases where an enterprise identity provider is used, the first and last names are represented as given_name and family_name within the user token context. However, in scenarios where that does not exist, you'll need add a rule to inject it. If that's the case, do the following: Check the Connections tab of the application config screen in Auth0. If you notice that the selected option is Database then you are relying on Auth0 to manage the user database and Auth0 stores minimal information in it's DB. On the left side, click on Rules, then click \"Create Rule\" and choose Empty Rule. Name the rule anything you want. For e.g, Add UserInfo To IdToken and overwrite the rule content with the following: function addNameToIdToken ( user , context , callback ) { // The standard OIDC claims first and last name are not in the // default DB backed user in Auth0. Venafi Cloud needs first and last name. // Adding the standard claims, given_name and family_name to idToken. // In this case adding nickname and name. if ( context . clientName === ' VaaS App For Certificates ' ) { context . idToken . given_name = user . nickname ; context . idToken . family_name = user . name ; } return callback ( null , user , context ); } In the example, you can see that the rule is applied only for the VaaS App For Certificates application. If you gave the application a different name, update the rule accordingly. To verify that your rule is functioning as expected, click Test Connection again (from the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page), which should then show given_name and last_name . After saving your changes to the new rule, do the following to verify that SSO works as expected: In Auth0, select Users & Roles , click Users , and then click Create User . Fill in the required fields, keeping the following points in mind: In Email , the email id must be part of the domain that is set up for using Venafi as a Service. In this case it is help.venafi.com . Make sure you've selected the correct connection. In this example, we're using a database called venafi-cloud-user-db . As this user was created using Auth0, an email verification link will not be sent automatically.

Go to ui.venafi.cloud and type ven-cloud-user@help.venafi.com , which is the new user you just created in Auth0. If configured correctly, a login screen appears. Once logged in, you'll see a welcome screen that then takes you to the Venafi as a Service home page.", "title": "Configuring Auth0 SSO integration with Venafi as a Service"}, {"location": "vcs-platform/configuring-auth0-sso-integration/#configuring-auth0-sso-integration-with-venafi-as-a-service", "text": "If Auth0 is your SSO solution, this topic shows you how to integrate Auth0 with Venafi as a Service. You can integrate Venafi as a Service with Auth0 to enable single sign-on (SSO) for user identities with which Auth0 can proxy. Auth0 is a flexible solution you can use to add authentication and authorization services to Venafi as a Service. Auth0 administrators can configure connections to various identity providers. These can include social connections such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, and LinkedIn, or enterprise connections such as SAML, OpenID Connect, Ping, Google G Suite, and so on. Alternatively, you could even use your own database. There are a number of options for you to choose from. TIP Because you'll be making changes in both the Auth0 portal and Venafi as a Service, you'll complete the configuration faster if you open both user interfaces side-by-side before proceeding. To set up this integration, you'll need to Configure Auth0 and Venafi as a Service to work together Test the connection between Venafi as a Service and Auth0 (Conditional) Add an additional rule to Auth0, if needed Configuring Auth0 and Venafi as a Service to work together Log in to your Auth0 account and click Applications . You'll notice that a default application is created for you already. Click Create Application . On the Create application page, type a name for the application (e.g. Venafi as a Service ), click Regular Web Application , and then click Create . TIP You can change the name of the application any time. More about this step Once the application is created, some information is filled in automatically. For example, notice that in the following image, the domain is your OIDC Issuer URL, the Client ID is the ID that represents your application, and the Client Secret is the secret that is required for configuring the option to sign in. From the Settings tab, under Basic information , copy the Domain , Client ID and Client Secret and paste them into a temporary file; these values are required later on when you configure SSO in Venafi as a Service. TIP Note that the redirect URI is sometimes referred to as the callback URI . You can have multiple callback (redirect) URI's. (Optional) You can download this logo file and select it from the Application Logo field if you plan on making the application visible to users on the Auth0 portal page: Log in to Venafi as a Service and go to the SSO configuration page (Venafi as a Service > Settings > Venafi as a Service Platform > Single Sign On > Configuration) and paste the values you got from the previous step into ClientId , Secret and Issuer URL . NOTE The Domain value (which you copied earlier) must be used in order to provide a correct OIDC Issuer URL. Refer to the earlier example screenshot of Domain in the Auth0 Application Settings tab. To ensure that it is properly recognized, the URL should be https:// domain from Auth0 /. If the issuer URL is configured incorrectly, you'll see an error indicating that the issuer URL does not match. Next to Redirect URL , click to copy the redirect URL, and then in Auth0 , on the Application Properties page, scroll down and paste the redirect URL into Allowed Callback URLs . The redirect URL is important because after the login process is complete, Auth0 must know where to send (redirect) users who've successfully logged in. Save your changes in Auth0 . You are now done configuring the Venafi as a Service application in Auth0. The next step is to test your connection. Testing the connection between Venafi as a Service and Auth0 From the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page, click Test connection . When prompted by Auth0 , type your enterprise credentials. When the authentication succeeds, you're redirected back to the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page. From there, you can view the claims that were returned in the OIDC token issued by Auth0. Save your SSO configuration. (Conditional) Add an additional rule to Auth0, if needed Venafi as a Service requires that the standard claims of first name and last name are included as part of the user context in the token. Depending on your configuration of Auth0, you might have to add an additional rule to ensure that the standard claims are part of the user context. In almost all cases where an enterprise identity provider is used, the first and last names are represented as given_name and family_name within the user token context. However, in scenarios where that does not exist, you'll need add a rule to inject it. If that's the case, do the following: Check the Connections tab of the application config screen in Auth0. If you notice that the selected option is Database then you are relying on Auth0 to manage the user database and Auth0 stores minimal information in it's DB. On the left side, click on Rules, then click \"Create Rule\" and choose Empty Rule. Name the rule anything you want. For e.g, Add UserInfo To IdToken and overwrite the rule content with the following: function addNameToIdToken ( user , context , callback ) { // The standard OIDC claims first and last name are not in the // default DB backed user in Auth0. Venafi Cloud needs first and last name. // Adding the standard claims, given_name and family_name to idToken. // In this case adding nickname and name. if ( context . clientName === ' VaaS App For Certificates ' ) { context . idToken . given_name = user . nickname ; context . idToken . family_name = user . name ; } return callback ( null , user , context ); } In the example, you can see that the rule is applied only for the VaaS App For Certificates application. If you gave the application a different name, update the rule accordingly. To verify that your rule is functioning as expected, click Test Connection again (from the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page), which should then show given_name and last_name . After saving your changes to the new rule, do the following to verify that SSO works as expected: In Auth0, select Users & Roles , click Users , and then click Create User . Fill in the required fields, keeping the following points in mind: In Email , the email id must be part of the domain that is set up for using Venafi as a Service. In this case it is help.venafi.com . Make sure you've selected the correct connection. In this example, we're using a database called venafi-cloud-user-db . As this user was created using Auth0, an email verification link will not be sent automatically. For testing purposes only, from the Details tab, under EMAIL , click Edit , and then in the Edit E-mail modal, click Set email as verified . Go to ui.venafi.cloud and type ven-cloud-user@help.venafi.com , which is the new user you just created in Auth0. If configured correctly, a login screen appears.

Venafi as a Service can be integrated with Azure AD to enable SSO for users who are managed by Azure AD (and any on-prem active directory forests that are synchronized with Azure AD). You do this by registering Venafi as a Service as an enterprise application in your AzureAD tenant. To set up this integration, you'll first create an App registration for Venafi as a Service within Azure AD. TIP As an option, you can also configure Azure AD to include user group information in OIDC tokens, and then configure Venafi as a Service with the URLs and client ID/secret needed to interface with Azure AD. Azure AD does not support requesting custom scopes to alter the claims returned in OIDC tokens. So, when using Azure AD, be sure to leave the Scopes field on Venafi as a Service's SSO configuration page blank. Tip Because you'll be making changes in both the Azure AD portal and Venafi as a Service, you'll complete the configuration faster if you open both user interfaces side-by-side before proceeding. To set up this integration, you'll need to Configure Azure AD and Venafi as a Service to work together Test the connection between Venafi as a Service and Azure AD (Optional) Add a Groups claim Step 1: Configuring Azure AD to work with Venafi as a Service Log in to your Azure account as a directory administrator or other user with permissions to create application registrations in your Azure AD tenant. Go to App registrations and click New registration . Type a name for the application (e.g. Venafi as a Service), and then configure supported account types. In Venafi as a Service , copy the Redirect URL from the SSO configuration page (Venafi as a Service > Settings > Venafi as a Service Platform > Single Sign On > Configuration) and paste it into the Redirect URI in Azure. After the registration is complete, you're directed to the App registration page for the Venafi as a Service application you just created. The next step then is to create a client secret for Venafi as a Service to use to authenticate with Azure AD. In Azure , go to Certificates & secrets , click New client secret , and then give your secret a description and specify its lifetime. TIP Be sure to give the secret a useful description, such as, Secret used by the Venafi as a Service application , which makes it easier to identify later on. Also, if you decide to use expiring client secrets, be sure to renew them and update Venafi as a Service with the new secrets as soon as possible. After creating the secret, copy the new secret's value (not the Secret ID), and then in Venafi as a Service , paste it into the Client Secret field on the SSO Configuration page. TIP After you leave the App registration blade, the client secret's value won't be visible again. Copy value of the secret ID to a secure password vault if you want to be able to retrieve it later on. In Azure , go to the Overview section in the App registration blade. Copy the Application (client) ID and then in Venafi as a Service , paste it into the Client ID field on the SSO Configuration page. In Azure , from the Overview section of the App registration blade, click Endpoints . This shows you the set of endpoints on which Azure AD provides OAuth/OIDC services. From the OpenID Connect metadata document field, select and copy only the following portion of the URL : https://login.domain.com/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/v2.0 (excluding /.well-known/openid-configuration ). For example, if the full URL were https://login.microsoftonline.com/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration , then you select and copy https://login.microsoftonline.com/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/v2.0 only, and paste it into the Issuer URL field on Venafi as a Service's SSO Configuration page.

The next step is to test your connection. Step 2: Testing the connection between Venafi as a Service and Azure AD From the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page, click Test connection . When prompted, type your enterprise credentials into Azure AD. When the authentication succeeds, you're redirected back to the Venafi as a Service SSO Configuration page. From there, you can view the claims that were returned in the OIDC token issued by Azure AD. Save your SSO configuration. Your users can now sign in using their SSO credentials. Step 3: Adding a Groups claim (Optional) Adding a groups claim in Azure AD allows group membership information to be sent to Venafi as a Service. Including group membership information in OIDC tokens allows you to leverage the Teams feature in Venafi as a Service to automatically add users to Teams and automatically assign a role to them based on your organization's requirements. In Azure AD , from the Venafi as a Service App registration blade, click Token configuration , and then click Add groups claim . Select the group types to include in the claim. Tip In most cases, All groups is the correct choice. But if you have a large number of groups in Azure AD, you might want to send only those groups that have been assigned to the application specifically. This approach lets you specify the set of groups that are relevant for Venafi as a Service at the App registration level so that the set of groups returned in a user's group claims are limited to just those groups that are explicitly assigned to the application.

In the Connect Scopes field, add the OpenID Profile, OpenID Email , and OpenID Connect scopes from the List of scopes to the Connected scopes . Important At a minimum, Venafi as a Service needs the profile, email and open ID scopes to be connected in order for SSO logins to function. In the Attribute Mapping field, select a value for the sub mapping (as required by PingOne), and then click Next . Best Practice We recommend that you use the mail attribute. In the Group Access section, select user groups in PingOne that should be allowed to access the Venafi as a Service service, and then click Done . Test your SSO configuration by clicking Test Connection . If your configuration was completed correctly, you should see the ID token returned in the response. Click Save . Your users can now sign in to Venafi as a Service using SSO through PingOne. What's Next \u00b6 Consider configuring PingOne to include a groups claim, which allows group membership information to be sent to Venafi as a Service. While group membership information is not currently used by Venafi as a Service, future releases will add more functionality that will depend upon group claims in useful ways. All you need to do is update the Venafi as a Service application you just created in PingOne by adding a new scope and corresponding claim. To configure PingOne to include a groups claim \u00b6 Sign in to your PingOne console and click Applications > OAuth settings . Click the Scopes tab, click Add Scope , and then add a scope Value and Name. The scope value is the value that will be included in OAuth requests sent by Venafi as a Service to PingOne. The name you use for the scope is displayed in the PingOne admin console. Best Practice Consider using a simple naming scheme. For example, you could use groups for the scope and Enterprise user groups for the name. In the Enter Claim field, type a name for the claim to be returned in the response that is sent back to Venafi as a Service, and then click Save . Consider using the same name for the claim as the scope that was provided above (so for example, the name would be groups. Click the Attribute Mapping tab, locate the claim that was created in the previous step, and then in the Mapping column, choose the user attribute for the user's PingOne account that contains group information, and then click Save . Tip In almost all cases this will be the memberOf attribute. You can either select this value, or to display only the group name, you can use the Advanced function and use the GetFirstRelativeDN function to extract only the group name from the memberOf attribute. Go to My Applications > OIDC , find the application you created previously for Venafi as a Service, and then click the Edit icon. Click Scopes , locate and select the scope that you created in the List of Scopes and add it to Connected Scopes, and then click Save.

What role do you plan to assign to your team so that team members can do their work most effectively? If you're using SSO, does your SSO solution return additional information (called claims ) about your users that can be used to assign users to teams? About role assignments and Teams Within Venafi as a Service, user roles are assigned to users individually. This can be done either manually by an administrator, or it can be done automatically based on team membership. A user can't be assigned multiple roles within a single Venafi as a Service product. When a user is added to a team (either automatically or manually), Venafi as a Service examines the current role assigned to the user. If the user role is different than the role associated with the Team, Venafi as a Service changes the user's role to the role associated with the team automatically. If the user belongs to multiple Teams, Venafi as a Service calculates the highest privilege role from the set of Teams to which the user belongs, and then assigns the user to that role. For example, suppose you have 2 teams: TeamA and TeamB . TeamA is configured with the PKI Administrator role while TeamB is configured with the Resource Owner role. Alan is a user in Venafi as a Service that is currently assigned the Guest role. Alan is then added to TeamA and TeamB by each teams' respective owners.

If you plan to install on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), carefully review these special considerations . Who can create VSatellites? Venafi as a Service enables multiple user roles (such as PKI Administrators and System Administrators) to install VSatellites and pair them with your Venafi as a Service account. This is by design since using VSatellites enables users assigned varying roles the ability to discover and manage certificates found behind your firewall. Pre-requisites for installing VSatellites \u00b6 Before you install a VSatellite, carefully review the following important pre-requisites. System requirements \u00b6 Make sure that the target computer where you plan to install VSatellite meets the minimum requirements. Operating systems \u00b6 Supported: Ubuntu LTS 18.04 or later Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.9 RECOMMENDED Make sure that the operating system you use is updated with the latest patches. At a minimum, it must be able to retrieve updates from the operating system's standard software repository (for example, using apt-get or yum ). System resources \u00b6 You can install VSatellites on either virtual computers (most common) or on physical hardware. In either case, your target computer must meet or exceed the following: 4 GB RAM 2 CPUs 10 GB free disk space Networking connections \u00b6 VSatellite requires connectivity with specific endpoints and ports over HTTPS. Which endpoints are required depends on whether you use the --venafi-registry flag when running the VSatellite install. The --venafi-registry flag better secures and simplifies the installation of VSatellite by using only Venafi-hosted VSatellite artifacts. Required endpoints when using the --venafi-registry flag dl.venafi.cloud:443 registry.venafi.cloud:443 vsat-gw.venafi.cloud:9443 vsat-gw.venafi.cloud:443 vsat-login.venafi.cloud:443 rpm.rancher.io:443 (this applies ONLY when using RHEL on your target computer; see special considerations section below) Required endpoints when not using the --venafi-registry flag Venafi as a Service endpoints: dl.venafi.cloud:443 vsat-gw.venafi.cloud:9443 vsat-gw.venafi.cloud:443 vsat-login.venafi.cloud:443 Third-party endpoints: auth.docker.io:443 cdn02.quay.io:443 d2glxqk2uabbnd.cloudfront.net:443 github.com:443 objects.githubusercontent.com:443 production.cloudflare.docker.com:443 public.ecr.aws:443 quay.io:443 quayio-production-s3.s3.amazonaws.com:443 registry-1.docker.io:443 rpm.rancher.io:443 (applicable only when using RHEL on your target computer) TIP: Verifying connectivity to required endpoints To quickly verify connectivity to the required endpoints, you could use the cURL utility to request headers from each base URL. For example: curl -I https://dl.venafi.cloud curl -I https://vsat-gw.venafi.cloud If you don't have cURL, you can install it on Ubuntu using apt-get install curl or on RHEL using yum install curl .

What's this? Each VSatellite has a pairing code (included within the setup command) that identifies it to Venafi as a Service and establishes a secure connection between your computer and Venafi as a Service. Once you configure a pairing code, it then has a fixed lifetime. Once configured, you'll have fixed window of time in which to use the pairing code to connect your VSatellite to Venafi as a Service.
