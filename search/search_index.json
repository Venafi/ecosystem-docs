Ready to certify? If you've already completed your integration and are ready to submit a request for Certification, you can start here. As a TLS Protect Cloud Certified integration, Venafi users have an extra level of confidence that your solution was designed with their best interests at the forefront. For that reason, certified integrations see more adoption from our mutual customer base. When building an integration to TLS Protect Cloud , one desired outcome should be official certification. Official certification is the first step to listing the integration on the Venafi Marketplace , which is the #1 way end users discover and deploy integrations. Certification is the only way that an integration will be listed on the Venafi Marketplace as compatible with TLS Protect Cloud . The TLS Protect Cloud Certification Program is still evolving and so some specifics about the following requirements are subject to change. Ample notice will be given to any developers of an existing certified integration, ensuring plenty of time to make any necessary updates to maintain certification. The following requirements are applicable to every TLS Protect Cloud integration, however there may be additional, unlisted requirements depending on the specific use case of the integration. There will be integrations and use cases that come forward that are totally new and unique from every integration that has gone through the certification process - and that\u2019s GREAT! It means machine identity management is continuing to evolve and see continued adoption. We're all in this together In cases where the Venafi team requests additional requirements be met, we will work with you to determine what success looks like and do our best to provide any tools/guidance necessary to reach certification. Technical Certification vs. Partner Program \u00b6 The technical certification process is not to be confused with Venafi Partnership, though the two are related. The best way to think about it would be \u201cPackaging\u201d vs. \u201cMarketing.\u201d Packaging \u00b6 The final step of the TLS Protect Cloud certification process will be Packaging - deciding how end users will deploy and interact with your integration. In order for end users to discover the integration and establish a strong user base, the packaging of the integration should be polished and easy to understand. Use of company logos, iconography, product names, marketing copy, etc. will all help users quickly identify your integration in the growing Venafi Marketplace . Marketing \u00b6 Marketing , on the other hand, focuses on bringing attention to a fully packaged & published integration. Once the integration has been certified and the initial Marketplace Listing has been created, the next logical step would be an official partnership with Venafi, which will also engage the Venafi Partner Marketing team to start making some noise about the new solution available to Venafi users. Certification Requirements \u00b6 There are currently two levels of certification for TLS Protect Cloud integrations, Foundation Certification and Advanced Certification . It's our hope that every developer strives for the most comprehensive integration, but understand that isn't always possible due to resource and/or time constraints. The purpose of creating two levels of certification is two-fold: It provides a lower barrier to entry for smaller organizations and individual contributors It provides an opportunity for developers to further differentiate their integration by providing additional collateral that will help end users get started #fastsecure . Foundation Certification \u00b6 Meeting the requirements for Foundation Certification should be the first point of focus for any new developer. These requirements have been designed to create a simple pathway for developers to get a listing onto the Venafi Marketplace, while ensuring a consistent, stable experience for all TLS Protect Cloud end users. All TLS Protect Cloud integrations that are published on the Venafi Marketplace are required to meet the requirements for Foundation Certification . Foundation Certification Requirements \u00b6 The description of the integration is an accurate representation of functionality. The integration doesn't interfere with TLS Protect Cloud native functionality or performance. The integration was developed with overall security best practices in mind and makes no attempts to harvest user data. The integration uses generally available interfaces to interact with TLS Protect Cloud (REST API, Vcert, etc.). Accompanying documentation must be packaged with the integration and should include any necessary configuration instructions as well as clear usage examples. Templates are provided for this purpose. The support model is clearly defined for all user types. A demonstration of all documented functionality must be scheduled & completed with the Venafi Ecosystem team. Advanced Certification \u00b6 Advanced Certification provides a means to differentiate an integration that goes above & beyond the requirements specified above. Functionally, both Foundation Certification and Advanced Certification have the same technical requirements. The difference between the two levels is really about end user enablement and ongoing testing to ensure the integration remains fully functional. From an end user's perspective, generally the more collateral available to be consumed, the less likely end users are to have questions that might block them from testing and ultimately utilizing the solution. The easier it is to deploy and test the integration, the more widely adopted that solution becomes throughout the user base. More users generate more feedback and ideas, and the integration becomes more robust as a result. Advanced Certification Requirements \u00b6 Everything listed in the Foundation Certification Requirements section, above, must be completed, in addition to the following: A 5-10 minute technical demonstration video covering any initial configuration and typical usage examples must be available online. When necessary, and if possible/feasible for the integration, a test instance or account will be provided to the Venafi Ecosystem team for internal testing and demonstration purposes. Automated testing must be put in place to test all documented functionality of your integration. All REST endpoints and/or VCert functions used by the integration must be documented and provided to Venafi. These will be used internally by Venafi to track which features & functions are being used most by developers and end users. They will not be shared publicly. Certification Process \u00b6 We've tried to make the certification process as simple and pain free as possible, but we're always looking to make it better. If you have any suggestions or feedback to improve the process, we'd love to hear them! Please send any feedback to Paul Cleary ( paul.cleary@venafi.com ). Once your integration has been built and been tested internally by your team, you've produced any accompanying documentation, and you've recorded a short video demo walking through each supported function of your integration, your project is ready for certification! Please click here to submit a Certification Request. \u00b6 FAQs \u00b6 QUESTION: Will my integration be listed on the Venafi Marketplace if I don't pursue official certification? ANSWER: Your integration may still be listed if it works with Venafi Trust Protection Platform, but it will not be listed as officially compatible with TLS Protect Cloud and will not have the official badge of certification. QUESTION: How long will the certification process take? ANSWER: The certification process itself moves relatively quickly - you've already done the time-consuming part building and documenting the integration. Once you've submitted a Request for Certification, it typically takes only a couple of days to schedule the final milestone demo (a short session for you to demonstrate the described functionality to the Venafi Ecosystem team). QUESTION: Will I receive any marketing assets that I can use on my own websites and collateral? ANSWER: Yes, definitely! We love seeing Venafi certification badges out in the wild. Official badges will be provided upon completion of the certification process. QUESTION: How often will I be required to re-certify my integration? ANSWER: Great question - thanks for asking! For now, we'd like you to re-certify for any Major release or feature addition/enhancement. Minor releases don't require re-certification.

Introduction \u00b6 Organizations use machine identities to secure traffic to and from their workloads using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTPS being the most common use case. Sometimes those machine identities are installed at the application endpoint, itself (i.e. source code). Other times, they may be installed on a load balancer, proxy or, in this case, a Cloud WAF . Before you begin, it's important to understand the \"whats\" and \"whys\" of Cloud WAFs . What is it? \u00b6 A WAF is a type of reverse proxy which protects the application itself from vulnerabilities caused by malicious activity. WAFs use machine identities in one of two ways: Securing traffic to the admin interface of the WAF itself Securing traffic to the applications being managed by the WAF Regardless of the purpose, proper management of those machine identities are critical to the availability and security of the workload. When active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen. Outages Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage . When you choose to secure your workloads , you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself. This is because machine identities expire and it is your responsibility to handle these scenarios. A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue. Automation using the Machine Identity Management Control Plane is a key defense against outages. Securing traffic to the admin interface of the WAF itself \u00b6 While WAFs don't typically protect the traffic to their own administration interfaces in the same way they do for managed applications, ensuring that administrator traffic is encrypted with an enterprise-trusted machine identity is just as important. If that traffic is not secured, admin credentials are at risk of leaking. If operations involving the machine identity are not automated, admins can experience outages when logging in to make changes. This could potentially present a cascading effect if they are investigating an ongoing threat or mitigating an issue. Securing traffic to the applications being managed by the WAF \u00b6 This design pattern focuses on the use case of orchestrating the delivery of machine identities to the WAF , as well as automating any configuration necessary to activate or associate those machine identities to target applications being secured by the WAF . The best solutions will require as little, if any at all, human interaction as possible after initial configuration. Why is machine identity automation necessary? \u00b6 Requirements and Considerations \u00b6 Primers \u00b6 We think you'll find the following references helpful when developing your solution.

Ingress may provide load balancing, TLS termination and intelligent routing. Introduction \u00b6 Kubernetes is is considered to be a platform for building platforms . As such, it has a reduced set of opinions about how business demands can be met. This creates voids which the Kuberenetes community rushes in to fill. One such area is ingress controllers, for which the community has provided many options . Before you begin, it's important to understand the \"whats\" and \"whys\" of Ingress and Ingress Controllers . What is it? \u00b6 Organizations use machine identities to secure traffic to and from their workloads using Transport Layer Security (TLS), with HTTPS being the most common use case. Sometimes those machine identities are installed at the application endpoint itself (i.e. the container image). Other times, they may be installed on a load balancer or proxy. Regardless of the location, proper management of that machine identity is critical to the availability and security of the workload. When active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen. Outages Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage .

The best solutions will require as little, if any at all, human interaction as possible after initial configuration. Why is it necessary? \u00b6 The internet was originally envisioned as a medium for sharing information, however the modern world demands that access to information should be much better protected. To meet these demands we have seen the steady rise of HTTPS to the point where modern browsers baulk at the use of plain old HTTP . So TLS is now a mandatory requirement and, henceforth, we all need to concern ourselves with the need for security of data in transit. There is a strong argument to suggest that developers should keep non-functional requirements such a data security outside their codebase. One of the benefits of placing a proxy, such as those under the control of an ingress controller, between your workload and the world beyond is that developers can isolate important aspects of software delivery and focus solely on business requirements.

The Ecosystem predicts the future needs of Customers ahead of their needs; with Customers continuing to use more of Venafi to solve Machine Identity Management problems and increase their success with Ecosystem-developed solutions. Ecosystem values every developer and is building for developer success . Developers have every opportunity to complete projects, promote to Customers, drive use by Customers, increase contribution, and grow licensed revenue. Ecosystem enables Developers to build more innovation faster without wasting time. Developers value this and see the benefit in time to get their innovation to Customers, write less code, update faster, and see use grow faster. Ecosystem always innovates, never copies to futureproof customer success . Ecosystem initiatives are unique to Venafi and never copies of a competitor. This means the Ecosystem is always bringing new developer solutions for Machine Identity Management ahead of competition. It is always looking for new ideas from innovators not past success. Speed matters . Many decisions are reversible and do not need extensive study. Ecosystem encourages and values calculated risk taking. Ecosystem values failures as opportunities to learn from. Ecosystem is never afraid to fail and learn more to improve. Because the Ecosystem is working to the future, it accepts that it may be misunderstood for long periods of time. Ecosystem is always improving the developer experience so that almost all developer project started are completed and that every year the time to complete projects decreases by 50%. Wherever possible, developer experience is focused on a more gamified and interactive approach, rather than a checkbox exercise. Ecosystem builds intelligence by collecting developer and customer usage data so that 100% of customer use of Marketplace and 100% use by Customers of developer solutions can be learned from and used to provide new insights and improvements that futureproofs customer success. Ecosystem makes sure 100% of Developers are never left behind to futureproof customer success when updates to Venafi APIs are made by providing training, documentation, tools that make any transition and updates easy and fast.

The Ecosystem prioritizes outcomes for the Design Customer of the Future. Venafi is the organizer and a participant in the Ecosystem where the majority of solutions are built by external Developers and Customers. Developers are startups (e.g. Akeyless), consultancies (e.g. OpenCredo), leading technologies (e.g. CyberArk), and individuals (e.g. Siggi Skulason) that create solutions that perform or make use of Machine Identity Management. Innovation occurs naturally with the most diverse range of Developers building solutions that benefit Venafi Customers. The outcome is that Customers have the confidence to deliver their Machine Identity Management strategy today and into the future. A clear measure of Customer confidence is consistent, increasing use of Ecosystem-developed solutions. This drives a secondary measure: more Developers build more solutions for Venafi Customers, increasing the diversity in terms of Developers and offerings. Each year at least 20 Developers come to Venafi to join the Ecosystem and build for Venafi. All of this makes it easier and faster for Venafi to recruit new Developers to the Ecosystem.

Decide which DevKit you'll need Build & test your driver using the tools provided in the DevKit Test your driver against TLS Protect Datacenter Submit your driver to Cool Solutions (Venafi's managed GitLab instance) Complete the Marketplace Listing Questionnaire Adaptable Framework Overview \u00b6 The following guidelines apply generally to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Drivers rely on System.Management.Automation in .NET to invoke PowerShell functions inside a locally hosted script PowerShell functions must not return errors; rather, they must throw exceptions in the same way that actual PowerShell errors do - the adaptable CA driver treats exceptions thrown by a PowerShell function as a fatal error and then halts processing PowerShell functions are responsible for ensuring that data meets the requirements of the integration point Hash Tables \u00b6 Venafi passes variables to (and receives them from) PowerShell functions in the form of hash tables, which are generally easier to work with and allows for the addition of variables without changing the function definition. A general hash table, which includes a common set of data available from Venafi, is passed to all the functions A specific hash table, which includes data that is applicable only to the specific function, is passed to some functions that require additional data All functions must return a single hash table that includes a result along with any other variables that the function is required to return Minimum Requirements \u00b6 PowerShell 3.0 or later .NET 4.6.1 or later NOTE: If your product does not support TLS 1.3, you will need to add the following code to your Adaptable script in order for it to work with the Venafi Platform. [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Adaptable Framework Best Practices \u00b6 The following recommended best practices apply to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Naming Conventions \u00b6 To avoid collisions, you should adopt a standard naming convention that will be used when creating objects (certificates, devices, applications) in Venafi. Collisions can occur when the name you define already exists in Venafi's inventory. You can use the same prefix or suffix, and then add something unique to the name. Suppose your driver connects to a device object via API and imports all the machine identities currently in use on the device. In addition to the certificates themselves being imported, a unique application object must be created as well, which will contain all the metadata (port, partition, profile, configuration options, etc.) needed for Venafi to automatically provision that certificate during a renewal. NOTE: When creating new PowerShell scripts for use with adaptable drivers, keep in mind that the file name is used to identify your script from within the associated object (and within the policy for the Adaptable Application driver) in Trust Protection Platform. Using logical names can help you and other administrators recognize the purpose and intent of each script. Credentials & Authentication \u00b6 Credential objects store the credentials Trust Protection Platform uses to authenticate with devices, applications, CAs, and Active Directory user directories. The stored credential may be a password, a username and password, a certificate, a file paired with a password, or a private key. Trust Protection Platform requires these credentials so it can manage the certificates associated with these devices, applications, and CAs. Credential objects provide an innovative way to centrally manage and share your system credentials. Each credential object can be associated with a single device or application, or it can be shared by multiple objects. After you create your system\u2019s credential objects, you do not have to repeat the credential configuration for each device or application. You simply reference the existing credential object. If the credential changes\u2014for example, an organization might change username and password credentials every 90 days\u2014you merely update the single credential object to give Trust Protection Platform access to all associated devices and applications. Reuse credential objects wherever standardization is possible to avoid creating extraneous objects. Recommend assigning credentials to a Policy folder that contains multiple devices. The policy credentials allow multiple devices to use the same credential. Certificate \"Installations\" \u00b6 Within a customer\u2019s environment, there may be circumstances that require the same certificate to be installed in multiple locations (high-availability, load balancing, etc.). If that is the case, the Venafi platform needs to be made aware of each location. This ensures there are no blind spots for the Security or PKI team, and also provides Venafi the information necessary to automatically provision and activate that certificate during renewal operations. It is critical if your application supports multiple installations of the same certificate, that ALL of those locations be reported back to Venafi. Data Validation \u00b6 You should implement effective data validation in order to catch errors in the script: Check values for validity that are being passed into functions Check values for validity before passing data back to Venafi Logging \u00b6 Generally, Adaptable Framework scripts don\u2019t need to do any logging unless it\u2019s for temporary, debugging purposes. The Adaptable drivers are logging to the standard Venafi logging channel when they call various PowerShell functions. Starting in TPP 19.3, developers can toggle debug logging for individual Adaptable drivers. This sets a $DEBUG_FILE global variable in the Adaptable driver. If toggled on, the script should be logging \u2013 If toggled off, it shouldn\u2019t. The $DEBUG_FILE variable gets set automatically to a suggested file path on the Venafi server for the script to write logs to, using a unique identifier. This is to avoid issues if there are multiple instances trying to write data to the same file. If additional, permanent logs are needed, use Write-EventLog to capture important logging and debug information to the Windows Event Log Throw exceptions back to Venafi Write effective error messages that tell users what went wrong and how to fix the issue General Tips \u00b6 Ideally, certificates should be referenced using the GUID of the certificate object Listing all certificates in a folder could be problematic because there may be a very high number of certificates in some policy folders. A better approach would be to check (search) whether a specific certificate already exists within a given policy folder.
