Introduction \u00b6 As a TLS Protect Cloud Certified solution, Venafi users have an extra level of confidence that your solution was designed with their best interests at the forefront. For that reason, certified solutions see more adoption from our mutual users. When building an solution to TLS Protect Cloud , one desired outcome should be official certification. Official certification is the first step to listing the solution on the Venafi Marketplace , which is the #1 way end users discover and deploy solutions. Certification is the only way that an solution will be listed on the Venafi Marketplace as compatible with TLS Protect Cloud . The TLS Protect Cloud Certification Program is still evolving and so some specifics about the following requirements are subject to change. Ample notice will be given to any developers of an existing certified solution, ensuring plenty of time to make any necessary updates to maintain certification. The following requirements are applicable to every TLS Protect Cloud solution, however there may be additional, unlisted requirements depending on the specific use case of the solution. There will be solutions and use cases that come forward that are totally new and unique from every solution that has gone through the certification process - and that's GREAT! It means machine identity management is continuing to evolve and see continued adoption. We're all in this together In cases where the Venafi team requests additional requirements be met, we will work with you to determine what success looks like and do our best to provide any Tools/guidance necessary to reach certification. Technical Certification vs. Partner Program \u00b6 The technical certification process is not to be confused with Venafi Partnership, though the two are related. The best way to think about it would be \"Packaging\" vs. \"Marketing\". Packaging \u00b6 The final step of the TLS Protect Cloud certification process will be Packaging - deciding how end users will deploy and interact with your solution. In order for end users to discover the solution and establish a strong user base, the packaging of the solution should be polished and easy to understand. Use of company logos, iconography, product names, marketing copy, etc. will all help users quickly identify your solution in the growing Venafi Marketplace . Marketing \u00b6 Marketing , on the other hand, focuses on bringing attention to a fully packaged & published solution.

It's our hope that every developer strives for the most comprehensive solution, but understand that isn't always possible due to resource and/or time constraints. The purpose of creating multiple levels of certification is two-fold: It provides a lower barrier to entry for smaller organizations and individual contributors It provides an opportunity for developers to further differentiate their solution by providing additional collateral that will help end users get started #fastsecure when using the solution. Meeting the requirements for Foundation Certification should be the first point of focus for any new developer. These requirements have been designed to create a simple pathway for developers to get a listing onto the Venafi Marketplace, while ensuring a consistent, stable experience for all TLS Protect Cloud end users. All TLS Protect Cloud solutions that are published on the Venafi Marketplace are required to meet the requirements for Foundation Certification. Advanced Certification provides a means to differentiate an solution that goes above & beyond the requirements specified above. Functionally, both Foundation Certification and Advanced Certification have the same technical requirements. The difference between the two levels is really about end user enablement and ongoing testing to ensure the solution remains fully functional. From an end user's perspective, generally the more collateral available to be consumed, the less likely end users are to have questions that might block them from testing and ultimately utilizing the solution. The easier it is to deploy and test the solution, the more widely adopted that solution becomes throughout the user base. More users generate more feedback and ideas, and the solution becomes more robust as a result. Certification Requirements \u00b6 Foundation Advanced The description of the solution is an accurate representation of functionality. The solution doesn't interfere with TLS Protect Cloud native functionality or performance. The solution was developed with overall security best practices in mind and makes no attempts to harvest user data. The solution uses generally available interfaces to interact with TLS Protect Cloud (VCert, REST API, etc.). Accompanying documentation must be packaged with the solution and should include any necessary configuration instructions as well as clear usage examples. Templates are provided for this purpose. The support model is clearly defined for all user types. A demonstration of all documented functionality must be scheduled & completed with the Venafi Ecosystem team. Everything listed in the Foundation Certification Requirements section tab be completed, in addition to the following: A 5-10 minute technical demonstration video covering any initial configuration and typical usage examples must be available online. When necessary, and if possible/feasible for the solution, a test instance or account will be provided to the Venafi Ecosystem team for internal testing and demonstration purposes. Automated testing must be put in place to test all documented functionality of your solution. All REST endpoints and/or VCert functions used by the solution must be documented and provided to Venafi. These will be used internally by Venafi to track which features & functions are being used most by developers and end users. They will not be shared publicly.

ANSWER: Your solution may still be listed, but it will not be listed as officially compatible with TLS Protect For Kubernetes and will not have the official badge of certification. How long will the certification process take? ANSWER: The certification process itself moves relatively quickly - you've already done the time-consuming part building and documenting the solution. Once you've submitted a Request for Certification, it typically takes only a couple of days to schedule the final milestone demo (a short session for you to demonstrate the described functionality to the Venafi Ecosystem team). Will I receive any marketing assets that I can use on my own websites and collateral? ANSWER: Yes, definitely! We love seeing Venafi certification badges out in the wild. Official badges will be provided upon completion of the certification process. How often will I be required to re-certify my solution? ANSWER: For now, we'd like you to re-certify for any Major release or feature addition/enhancement. Minor releases don't require re-certification.

Introduction \u00b6 Organizations use machine identities to secure traffic to and from their workloads using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTPS being the most common use case. Sometimes those machine identities are installed at the application endpoint, itself (i.e. source code). Other times, they may be installed on a load balancer, proxy or, in this case, a Cloud WAF . Design Pattern: Cloud WAF This design pattern focuses on the use case of orchestrating the delivery of machine identities to the WAF , as well as automating any configuration necessary to activate or associate those machine identities to target applications being secured by the WAF . Before you begin, it's important to understand the \"whats\" and \"whys\" of Cloud WAFs . What is it? \u00b6 A WAF is a type of reverse proxy which protects the application itself from vulnerabilities caused by malicious activity. WAFs use machine identities in one of two ways: Securing traffic to the admin interface of the WAF itself Securing traffic to the applications being managed by the WAF Securing Traffic to the Admin Interface \u00b6 While WAFs don't typically protect the traffic to their own administration interfaces in the same way they do for managed applications, ensuring that administrator traffic is encrypted with an enterprise-trusted machine identity is just as important. If that traffic is not secured, admin credentials are at risk of leaking. If operations involving the machine identity are not automated, admins can experience outages when logging in to make changes. This could potentially present a cascading effect if they are investigating an ongoing threat or mitigating an issue. Securing Traffic to Applications \u00b6 Securing traffic to applications managed by the WAF is slightly more complex since there can be multiple applications being managed by a WAF , and each application needs its own machine identity . There are typically two options for machine identity automation targeting application traffic. Which option you choose will depend on the WAF product or service your solution is being built for. The WAF has a built-in Certificate Authority (CA) \u00b6 In this scenario, the WAF terminates the original TLS connection, and uses its built-in CA to issue new machine identities for traffic between the WAF and the application. Some next-gen WAFs can generate machine identities at just-in-time speed. It's critical that every machine identity is trusted by the organization, and every issuance is known and traceable by the Machine Identity Management Control Plane . The WAF stores a copy of the machine identity (including the private key) for each app \u00b6 In this scenario, the WAF maintains a copy of the machine identity for each application under management. When a machine identity is renewed, both the application and the WAF will need the new version. Why is machine identity automation necessary? \u00b6 Proper management of these machine identities is critical to the availability and security of the applications being managed by the WAF . When active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen. Outages Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage . When you choose to secure your workloads , you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself. This is because machine identities are designed to expire after some predefined duration. When machine identities expire they stop working and the workloads they protect become unavailable. A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue. Automation using the Machine Identity Management Control Plane is a key defense against outages. These types of outages can occur for a variety of reasons, including human error or oversight, unnecessary bottlenecks during approval workflows or a general lack of automation . In addition to machine identities for each application, the solution must be capable of storing and using any additional configuration information and metadata required by the WAF to use the machine identity once it is provisioned. This introduces another failure point, and another potential outage to be aware of. Users of the Machine Identity Management Control Plane benefit from key outcomes solving common problems. They are automating everywhere by removing manual steps from the machine identity management process, enabling teams to scale quickly, while still maintaining compliance and control. by enabling teams to use whatever tools they know and prefer, and not forcing them to wait for unnecessary approval step bottlenecks. They are preventing misuse and compromise of machine identities in their organization by providing complete visibility and flexible policy to security teams, while maintaining that automation-enabled efficiency from above.

Ingress may provide load balancing, TLS termination, intelligent routing and API Gateway functionality. cert-manager integrates with Ingress objects to fulfill their role in securing your Kubernetes clusters. TLS Protect For Kubernetes, which provides first-class support for Ingress objects, includes an enterprise-hardened version of cert-manager and capabilities to support machine identities in the enterprise. Introduction \u00b6 Kubernetes is a platform for building platforms which helps companies modernize with speed and agility . It has a reduced set of opinions about how business demands are fulfilled. This creates technological voids which the Kuberenetes community strives to fill. One such area is Ingress Controllers , for which the community has provided many options . Design Pattern: Ingress This design pattern focuses on the use case of leveraging machine identities via ingress controllers. It highlights the need for automation to ensure that once your solution is deployed it stays there, proactively securing workloads long into the future. Before you begin, it's important to understand the \"what\", \"why\" and \"how\" of Ingress . What is it? \u00b6 An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource. Objects of this type represent lines of communication from outside a cluster (which could mean the internet) to workloads running inside this cluster. Ingress objects bring network intelligence to multi-purpose proxy servers in the form of rules-based routing. Without the ability to span this divide Kubernetes would be isolated from the outside world and limited to running non-interactive workloads such as batch jobs. The Ingress resource is native to Kubernetes but Ingress Controller resources are not. An Ingress object can exist, but without an associated controller to respond, it will remain dormant - somewhat like a car without a driver. Selecting a suitable Ingress Controller is a choice each cluster intends for you to make. Why is it necessary? \u00b6 In addition to rules-based routing Ingress Controllers also provide enhanced security which, given the importance of machine identities, should be your primary concern. The internet was originally envisioned as a medium for sharing information, however the modern world demands that information should be much better protected. To meet these demands we have seen the steady rise of HTTPS to the point where modern browsers baulk at the use of plain old HTTP so Transport Layer Security (TLS), which powers HTTPS, is now a mandatory requirement. Henceforth you need to enforce the security of your data in transit . Doing so with an Ingress Controller moves TLS termination closer to your workloads thereby helping to prevent misuse and compromise . Organizations use machine identities to provide end-to-end security of data sent between running processes with the TLS cryptographic protocol. The use of X.509 certificates and HTTPS are the most common manifestation of this. Those machine identities are sometimes installed at the application endpoint - as a layer of configuration inside your container images. Cloud native principles such as 12 factor dependencies may convince you this is the right choice. It's certainly convenient but this approach has a major flaw in that machine identities eventually expire so they must not be treated as static dependencies of your workloads . This matters because when active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen. Outages Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage . When you choose to secure your workloads , you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself. This is because machine identities are designed to expire after some predefined duration. When machine identities expire they stop working and the workloads they protect become unavailable. A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue. Automation using the Machine Identity Management Control Plane is a key defense against outages. There are further limitations that stem from the use of containers with pre-baked security measures but the example above represents one that can be effectively tackled through the use of an Ingress. How it helps? \u00b6 You can stop outages caused by expiring machine identities with the use of an proxy placed in front of your workload. This proxy should be configured to enforce TLS and act as the point of TLS termination. This means that traffic touching the internet can be HTTPS whilst traffic touching the workload can remain as plain old HTTP. The configuration of this proxy is determined by how your Ingress Controller interprets your Ingress objects. Your Ingress Controller should be able to inject your machine identity into this proxy at the point of creation. Perhaps more importantly, since machine identities are a dynamic dependency of your workload, your Ingress Controller should also be able to re-inject machine identities, whenever they are renewed. This approach adheres to the principle of automating everywhere and can permanently eliminate machine identity expiry as a outage risk. Thankfully, the Ingress specification accommodates TLS protection as an explicit attribute. This is a clear indication that all Ingress Controller implementations are expected to provide proactive TLS support, relieving your workloads of that responsibility.","title":"For Ingress"},{"location":"Developers/Design-Patterns/For-Ingress/0-intro-ingress/#ingress","text":"Ingress is the term used for a native Kubernetes resource that details the external routes into a cluster.

When you choose to secure your workloads , you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself. This is because machine identities are designed to expire after some predefined duration. When machine identities expire they stop working and the workloads they protect become unavailable. A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue. Automation using the Machine Identity Management Control Plane is a key defense against outages. There are further limitations that stem from the use of containers with pre-baked security measures but the example above represents one that can be effectively tackled through the use of an Ingress.","title":"Why is it necessary?"},{"location":"Developers/Design-Patterns/For-Ingress/0-intro-ingress/#how-it-helps","text":"You can stop outages caused by expiring machine identities with the use of an proxy placed in front of your workload. This proxy should be configured to enforce TLS and act as the point of TLS termination. This means that traffic touching the internet can be HTTPS whilst traffic touching the workload can remain as plain old HTTP. The configuration of this proxy is determined by how your Ingress Controller interprets your Ingress objects. Your Ingress Controller should be able to inject your machine identity into this proxy at the point of creation. Perhaps more importantly, since machine identities are a dynamic dependency of your workload, your Ingress Controller should also be able to re-inject machine identities, whenever they are renewed. This approach adheres to the principle of automating everywhere and can permanently eliminate machine identity expiry as a outage risk. Thankfully, the Ingress specification accommodates TLS protection as an explicit attribute. This is a clear indication that all Ingress Controller implementations are expected to provide proactive TLS support, relieving your workloads of that responsibility.","title":"How it helps?"},{"location":"Developers/Design-Patterns/For-Ingress/1-requirements-ingress/","text":"Requirements and Considerations \u00b6 When developing Ingress solutions for the Machine Identity Management Control Plane , you should always build with the goal of certification in mind.

It can also be referred to as the orchestration layer, or the management/control plane. Introduction \u00b6 Organizations use machine identities to secure traffic to and from their workloads using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTPS being the most common use case. Sometimes those machine identities are installed at the application endpoint, itself (i.e. source code). Other times, they may be installed on a load balancer, cloud WAF or, in this case, used by the management layer. Design Pattern: Management Layer This design pattern focuses on the use case of adding and/or enhancing functionality of the management layer to be Venafi-aware. In this design pattern, the management layer is responsible for automation of machine identities and Venafi is responsible for validating and responding to requests initiated by the management layer. Before you begin, it's important to understand the \"whats,\" \"whys\" and \"hows\" of various management layer solutions. What is it? \u00b6 The term \"management layer\" is somewhat generic, and can also be referred to by a few other terms such as \"orchestration layer,\" \"management/control plane,\" \"central manager,\" etc. Different software products may have their own \"productized\" name as well. Generally speaking, the primary use case for this \"management layer\" component is to provide a higher-level, more centralized view of all the devices, workloads , configurations, policies, etc. of the lower-level components in the infrastructure. EXAMPLE Consider Citrix Application Delivery Management (ADM) . ADM is a product from Citrix that provides centralized management and orchestration for Citrix's Application Delivery Controller (ADC) product line. It allows administrators to manage, configure, and deploy ADC apps and services from a single, centralized platform. This can help improve efficiency and reduce the time and effort needed to manage complex environments. ADM also provides additional features for monitoring and managing the performance and availability of ADC devices. Because security is just one piece of the configuration the management layer is responsible for, it makes sense that any configuration updates are initiated there. Multiple sources of truth can lead to collisions and synchronization issues since one source may not be aware of recent changes made by the other. For our purposes, the management layer should be considered the source of truth for ALL configuration information, including, but not limited to machine identities, used by the objects (devices/applications/services) under its management. Why is machine identity automation necessary? \u00b6 Proper management of these machine identities is critical to the availability and security of the applications/devices/services under the purview of the management layer. When active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen. Outages Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage . When you choose to secure your workloads , you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself. This is because machine identities are designed to expire after some predefined duration. When machine identities expire they stop working and the workloads they protect become unavailable. A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue. Automation using the Machine Identity Management Control Plane is a key defense against outages. These types of outages can occur for a variety of reasons, including human error or oversight, unnecessary bottlenecks during approval workflows or a general lack of automation . The management layer must be aware of any and all information associated with a given machine identity and any workloads consuming it, so that it can proactively renew and re-provision on a schedule or ad-hoc, at the time of need. EXAMPLE A good example is the expiry date of a certificate. The management layer should recognize the expiry date is upcoming and, if desired by the user, proactively renew the certificate. Additionally, the management layer is responsible for providing relevant information back to the Machine Identity Management Control Plane in order for the InfoSec or PKI team to maintain complete visibility into all machine identities in use throughout the organization. Users of the Machine Identity Management Control Plane benefit from key outcomes solving common problems. They are automating everywhere by removing manual steps from the machine identity management process, enabling teams to scale quickly, while still maintaining compliance and control. by enabling teams to use whatever tools they know and prefer, and not forcing them to wait for unnecessary approval step bottlenecks. They are stopping unnecessary outages by identifying, understanding and correcting situations and processes that could lead to an outage. by understanding that proper machine identity management is a shared responsibility between multiple teams, and working together increases the security posture of the organization. Developers like you help enable those teams to work together seamlessly. by being proactive instead of reactive. by doing all of the above .","title":"For Management Layer"},{"location":"Developers/Design-Patterns/For-Management-Layer/0-intro-management-layer/#management-layer","text":"In the context of enterprise software applications, \"management layer\" is a higher-level component that provides centralized control and coordination of the various other, lower-level components under its management.

Decide which DevKit you'll need Build & test your driver using the tools provided in the DevKit Test your driver against TLS Protect Datacenter Submit your driver to Cool Solutions (Venafi's managed GitLab instance) Complete the Marketplace Listing Questionnaire Adaptable Framework Overview \u00b6 The following guidelines apply generally to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Drivers rely on System.Management.Automation in .NET to invoke PowerShell functions inside a locally hosted script PowerShell functions must not return errors; rather, they must throw exceptions in the same way that actual PowerShell errors do - the adaptable CA driver treats exceptions thrown by a PowerShell function as a fatal error and then halts processing PowerShell functions are responsible for ensuring that data meets the requirements of the integration point Hash Tables \u00b6 Venafi passes variables to (and receives them from) PowerShell functions in the form of hash tables, which are generally easier to work with and allows for the addition of variables without changing the function definition. A general hash table, which includes a common set of data available from Venafi, is passed to all the functions A specific hash table, which includes data that is applicable only to the specific function, is passed to some functions that require additional data All functions must return a single hash table that includes a result along with any other variables that the function is required to return Minimum Requirements \u00b6 PowerShell 3.0 or later .NET 4.6.1 or later NOTE: If your product does not support TLS 1.3, you will need to add the following code to your Adaptable script in order for it to work with the Venafi Platform. [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Adaptable Framework Best Practices \u00b6 The following recommended best practices apply to all versions of the Adaptable Framework. Naming Conventions \u00b6 To avoid collisions, you should adopt a standard naming convention that will be used when creating objects (certificates, devices, applications) in Venafi. Collisions can occur when the name you define already exists in Venafi's inventory. You can use the same prefix or suffix, and then add something unique to the name. Suppose your driver connects to a device object via API and imports all the machine identities currently in use on the device. In addition to the certificates themselves being imported, a unique application object must be created as well, which will contain all the metadata (port, partition, profile, configuration options, etc.) needed for Venafi to automatically provision that certificate during a renewal. NOTE: When creating new PowerShell scripts for use with adaptable drivers, keep in mind that the file name is used to identify your script from within the associated object (and within the policy for the Adaptable Application driver) in Trust Protection Platform. Using logical names can help you and other administrators recognize the purpose and intent of each script. Credentials & Authentication \u00b6 Credential objects store the credentials Trust Protection Platform uses to authenticate with devices, applications, CAs, and Active Directory user directories. The stored credential may be a password, a username and password, a certificate, a file paired with a password, or a private key. Trust Protection Platform requires these credentials so it can manage the certificates associated with these devices, applications, and CAs. Credential objects provide an innovative way to centrally manage and share your system credentials. Each credential object can be associated with a single device or application, or it can be shared by multiple objects. After you create your system\u2019s credential objects, you do not have to repeat the credential configuration for each device or application. You simply reference the existing credential object. If the credential changes\u2014for example, an organization might change username and password credentials every 90 days\u2014you merely update the single credential object to give Trust Protection Platform access to all associated devices and applications. Reuse credential objects wherever standardization is possible to avoid creating extraneous objects. Recommend assigning credentials to a Policy folder that contains multiple devices. The policy credentials allow multiple devices to use the same credential. Certificate \"Installations\" \u00b6 Within a customer\u2019s environment, there may be circumstances that require the same certificate to be installed in multiple locations (high-availability, load balancing, etc.). If that is the case, the Venafi platform needs to be made aware of each location. This ensures there are no blind spots for the Security or PKI team, and also provides Venafi the information necessary to automatically provision and activate that certificate during renewal operations. It is critical if your application supports multiple installations of the same certificate, that ALL of those locations be reported back to Venafi. Data Validation \u00b6 You should implement effective data validation in order to catch errors in the script: Check values for validity that are being passed into functions Check values for validity before passing data back to Venafi Logging \u00b6 Generally, Adaptable Framework scripts don\u2019t need to do any logging unless it\u2019s for temporary, debugging purposes. The Adaptable drivers are logging to the standard Venafi logging channel when they call various PowerShell functions. Starting in TPP 19.3, developers can toggle debug logging for individual Adaptable drivers. This sets a $DEBUG_FILE global variable in the Adaptable driver. If toggled on, the script should be logging \u2013 If toggled off, it shouldn\u2019t. The $DEBUG_FILE variable gets set automatically to a suggested file path on the Venafi server for the script to write logs to, using a unique identifier. This is to avoid issues if there are multiple instances trying to write data to the same file. If additional, permanent logs are needed, use Write-EventLog to capture important logging and debug information to the Windows Event Log Throw exceptions back to Venafi Write effective error messages that tell users what went wrong and how to fix the issue General Tips \u00b6 Ideally, certificates should be referenced using the GUID of the certificate object Listing all certificates in a folder could be problematic because there may be a very high number of certificates in some policy folders. A better approach would be to check (search) whether a specific certificate already exists within a given policy folder.
