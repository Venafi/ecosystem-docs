To meet these demands we have seen the steady rise of HTTPS to the point where modern browsers baulk at the use of plain old HTTP so Transport Layer Security (TLS), which enables HTTPS, is now a mandatory requirement. Henceforth you need to enforce the security of your data in transit. Doing so with an Ingress Controller moves TLS termination closer to your workloads thereby helping to prevent misuse and compromise.</p> <p>Organizations use machine identities to provide end-to-end security of data sent between running processes with the TLS cryptographic protocol. The use of X.509 certificates and HTTPS are the most common manifestation of this.</p> <p>Those machine identities are sometimes installed at the application endpoint - as a layer of configuration inside your container images. Cloud native principles such as 12 factor dependencies may convince you this is the right choice. It's certainly convenient but this approach has a major flaw in that machine identities eventually expire so they must not be treated as static dependencies of your workloads.</p> <p>This matters because when active machine identities expire or become unavailable, outages happen.</p> Outages <p>Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an outage.</p> <p>When you choose to secure your workloads, you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the machine identity itself.
