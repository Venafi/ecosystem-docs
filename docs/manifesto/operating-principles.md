Venafi Ecosystem decision making is guided by 8 core principles:

> * **Ecosystem always futureproofs customer success** – for the organization, team, champion, and their career – by bringing together the world’s leaders and innovators to solve 100% of Machine Identity Management problems required today and into the future. The Ecosystem predicts the future needs of Customers ahead of their needs; with Customers continuing to use more of Venafi to solve Machine Identity Management problems and increase their success with Ecosystem-developed solutions. 

> * **Ecosystem values every developer and is building for developer success**. Developers have every opportunity to complete projects, promote to Customers, drive use by Customers, increase contribution, and grow licensed revenue. Ecosystem enables Developers to build more innovation faster without wasting time. Developers value this and see the benefit in time to get their innovation to Customers, write less code, update faster, and see use grow faster.

> * **Ecosystem always innovates, never copies to futureproof customer success**. Ecosystem initiatives are unique to Venafi and never copies of a competitor. This means the Ecosystem is always bringing new developer solutions for Machine Identity Management ahead of competition. It is always looking for new ideas from innovators not past success. 

> * **Speed matters**. Many decisions are reversible and do not need extensive study. Ecosystem encourages and values calculated risk taking. Ecosystem values failures as opportunities to learn from. Ecosystem is never afraid to fail and learn more to improve. Because the Ecosystem is working to the future, it accepts that it may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

> * **Ecosystem is always improving the developer experience** so that almost all developer project started are completed and that every year the time to complete projects decreases by 50%. Wherever possible, developer experience is focused on a more gamified and interactive approach, rather than a checkbox exercise.

> * **Ecosystem builds intelligence** by collecting developer and customer usage data so that 100% of customer use of Marketplace and 100% use by Customers of developer solutions can be learned from and used to provide new insights and improvements that futureproofs customer success. 

> * **Ecosystem makes sure 100% of Developers are never left behind** to futureproof customer success when updates to Venafi APIs are made by providing training, documentation, tools that make any transition and updates easy and fast. 

> * **Ecosystem certifies 100% of new developer solutions that meet published Venafi standards** to futureproof customer success and 100% of existing developer solutions are recertified at least once per year.
