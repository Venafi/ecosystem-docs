You can always review the details of the [Development Fund Program](devfund.md). 

### Milestones and Checkins
 A typical journey for a Developer funded by the program is organized by a series of milestones and actions.

This journey is managed through our Ecosystem Management Platform. If you do not yet have access to the platform, [send us a request](https://inviteme.paperform.co). 

This process should be followed by most Developers who are funded through Venafi's [Development Fund Program](devfund.md). In rare cases, exceptions have to be made. In which case, you will have milestones that are not part of the five outlined above. These milestone actions will be reflected in the above-mentioned platform.
