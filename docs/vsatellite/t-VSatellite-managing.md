# Managing your VSatellites

Typically, {{vsat}}s are managed within their containing {{vs}}
[environment](c-VSatellite-howItWorks.md).

As {{vsat}}s are designed to be light-weight and disposable (stateless), you can
easily add, remove and reconnect them from the *{{vsat}}s* page (**Settings** >
**{{vsat}}s**).

You can also monitor the status (and logs) of connected {{vsat}}s from the
{{vsat}}s page.

You can add and remove services to a {{vsat}} from the Services page (click
**Services** on the main menu bar).
