# Using Venafi VSatellites and Discovery Services to discover certificates on your internal networks

{{ven}} {{vsat}}s are a new, novel and critical part of {{vs}}, 
{{ven}}'s cloud-native machine-identity management service.

{{vsat}}s extend the reach of your {{vs}} account beyond 
publicly accessible networks and hosts, to your on-premise/private 
cloud networks and machines, enabling you to develop the full 
picture of your machine identities across your organization, 
irrespective of public or private visibility.

<!-- **(TBD: Overview InfoGraphic of VSat architecture; [start with 
this one from Walter](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/f0887f79-c3a8-4fc0-9e83-add50c7d6a1b) 
-->
This topic guides you through the entire process, from {{vsat}} 
deployment to discovery and validation of certificates discovered 
in your on-premise/private cloud networks and machines.

If you want to learn more about how VSatellite works before you 
continue, [click here](c-VSatellite-howItWorks.md).

## First things first 

In order to get a {{vsat}} connected to your {{vs}} account, you'll 
need to download and run a binary setup utility on a Linux computer 
within your target network. But remember, we'll walk you through 
this here. 

In the meantime, identify the target computer where you'll install 
{{vsat}} and make sure it meets the minimum system requirements:

- CentOS Linux release 8.3-2011 or later
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later LTS releases
- 4 GB RAM
- 2 CPUs
- 10 GB disk-space

!!! tip "Tip"
    {{vs}} enables multiple user roles, including PKI Administrators and System Administrators, to install {{vsat}} and pair them with your {{vs}} account. This is by design since using {{vsat}}s enables users assigned varying roles the ability to discover and manage certificates found behind your firewall.

## Let's get started

Click each step to go to the relevant task and then come back here for the next one.

1. [Create a new {{vsat}}](t-VSatellite-deployNew.md)
1. [Create a new Discovery Service and install and run Scanafi](t-Cloud-discovery-service.md)
1. [Following discovery, review the Certificate Inventory](finding-certificates.md)
1. [Configure your Discovery Service schedule](t-Cloud-discovery-service.md#disco-Schedule)
1. [Review and confirm successful certificate validations](validating-certificates.md)

<!--
Create new VSat
  - prereq steps: prepare a server to host it that's in your network
  - in vc, create new vsat ...see steps

Create new disco service
    - User creates a new service, assigns internal IP range, picks the VSatellite installed and Save Configuration
    - Download scanafi and run internal discovery to upload discovered certificates.
    - Check the certificate inventory to see the discovered certificates and installations

Configure discovery service schedule
    - Update the External discovery service to set the schedule in UTC time. 
    - On default intervals, certificates gets discovered and uploaded to inventory. To verify this play with the schedule

Verify Validation
    - Validation of Certificates from Internal Discovery should be updated once the schedule hits. User can verify this on their certificate installation inventory.


OTHER NOTES:

    - Personas who can Install vSatellite Hub in Cloud
        - Dirk Installs vSatellite from default environment
        - Able to configure services External Discovery Service
        - OP: Alan installs vSatellite
        - OP: Alan hands off/assigns the installation of vSatellite to another team
        - Dirk / Alan hands off to privileged users (external cluster tests)
