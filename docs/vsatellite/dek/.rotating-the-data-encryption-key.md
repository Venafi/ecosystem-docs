# Rotating your DEK

{{vs}} alerts you if your DEK is more than 90 days old. Rotating
your DEK at this interval aligns with most encryption compliance 
standards. After rotating your DEK, you will have a new DEK.

    Be sure to [back up your existing DEK](backing-up-the-data-encrption-key.md) prior to rotating it.

The script below does two things:

- Rotates the existing DEK

- Exports the new DEK so you can back up the new key

```
# Rotate the DEK on all {{vsat}}s
vsatctl --rotate-dek

# Export the new DEK for all VSatellites associated with your account
vsatctl --output-dek
```
