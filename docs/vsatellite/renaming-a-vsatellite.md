# Renaming VSatellites

You can easily rename a {{vsat}} from the Details page. 
When renaming a {{vsat}}, you must give it a unique name. 
After renaming a {{vsat}} successfully, there's nothing 
else you need to do. 

## To rename a VSatellite

1. Log in to {{vs}}.
1. Click **Infrastructure** > **{{vsat}}s**.
1. (Conditional) If the {{vsat}}s page isn't already in Detail view, click the Toggle switch to display Detail view. 
1. Select the {{vsat}}s you want to rename.
1. From the **Summary** tab, click in the **Name** field and type the new name.
    Be sure to enter a unique name, one that is not already in use by another existing {{vsat}}. If the name you use is not unique, you'll be prompted to type a different name.
1. Click **Save** to apply the new name.
