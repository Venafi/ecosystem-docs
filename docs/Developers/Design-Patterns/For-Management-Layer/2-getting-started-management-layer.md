## High-level Process

2. Decide on a programming language and understand what tooling, if any, your solution will use (If you aren't sure yet, [this](https://venafi-dev-onboarding.paperform.co/){: target="_blank" } might help).
3. Start building!
4. Perform [functional testing](3-functional-testing-management-layer.md).
5. Get [certified](../../Certification/TLS-Protect-Cloud/1-tlsp-certification-intro.md)!
