<!-- ## Our Audience

The Venafi Ecosystem represents the programmatic intersection of Venafi's products and customers.
We aim to ensure customers maximize the full potential of Venafi's products with minimal friction to their existing workflows.

Throughout this documentation the term "YOU", and its variants, represent experienced Software Developers.
These individuals or teams could be tasked with integrating a Certificate Authority, an API Gateway, a Service Mesh or any other component which could benefit from integration with Venafi's products. -->
