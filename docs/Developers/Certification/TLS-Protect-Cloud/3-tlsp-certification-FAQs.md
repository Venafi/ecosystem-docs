# Resources & FAQs

Below are some useful resources and frequently asked questions from previous developers who've already completed the certification process:

## Resources

- [Example Solution Repo](https://coolsolutions.venafi.com/ecosystem/example-integration-repo) - This provides a thorough example of how the README.md file should be created to be most impactful for Venafi users. Rather than creating Word documents or PDFs, all documentation should start in Markdown, which provides better version control and can then be easily translated to other formats as needed.
- [{{tlspc}} API Documentation](https://developer.venafi.com/tlsprotectcloud/reference/overview)
- [Venafi Marketplace](https://marketplace.venafi.com) - Explore the Marketplace to get an idea about some of the existing solutions to Venafi. 

## FAQs

??? question "Will my solution be listed on the Venafi Marketplace if I don't pursue official certification?"

    ANSWER: Your solution may still be listed if it works with {{tlspd}}, but it will not be listed as officially compatible with {{tlspc}} and will not have the official badge of certification.

??? question "How long will the certification process take?"

    ANSWER: The certification process itself moves relatively quickly - you've already done the time-consuming part building and documenting the solution. Once you've submitted a Request for Certification, it typically takes only a couple of days to schedule the final milestone demo (a short session for you to demonstrate the described functionality to the Venafi Ecosystem team).

??? question "Will I receive any marketing assets that I can use on my own websites and collateral?"

    ANSWER: Yes, definitely! We love seeing Venafi certification badges out in the wild. Official badges will be provided upon completion of the certification process.  

??? question "How often will I be required to re-certify my solution?"

    ANSWER: For now, we'd like you to re-certify for any Major release or feature addition/enhancement.
    Minor releases don't require re-certification.
    If you've just released a new Major version or added a new feature, please submit a new certification request.
