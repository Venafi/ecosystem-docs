# Certification - {{tlspk}}

This page is meant to be your home base throughout the certification process, so please feel free to jump around, read ahead, bookmark and come back to it as needed. 

??? question "Ready to certify?"

    If you've already completed your solution, understand and meet the necessary requirements and are ready to submit a request for Certification, you can [start here.](#certification-process)

## Introduction

As a **{{tlspk}} Certified** solution, Venafi users have an extra level of confidence that your solution was designed with their best interests at the forefront.
For that reason, certified solutions see more adoption from our mutual users.
When building a solution to {{tlspk}}, one desired outcome should be official certification.
Official certification is the first step to listing the solution on the [Venafi Marketplace](https://marketplace.venafi.com), which is the #1 way end users discover and deploy solutions.

    Certification is the only way that an solution will be listed on the Venafi Marketplace as compatible with {{tlspk}}.

The {{tlspk}} Certification Program is still evolving and so some specifics about the following requirements are subject to change.
Ample notice will be given to any developers of an existing certified solution, ensuring plenty of time to make any necessary updates to maintain certification.

The following requirements are applicable to every {{tlspk}} solution, however there may be additional, unlisted requirements depending on the specific use case of the solution.
There will be solutions and use cases that come forward that are totally new and unique from every solution that has gone through the certification process - and that's GREAT!
It means {{mim}} is continuing to evolve and see continued adoption.

!!! note "We're all in this together"

    In cases where the Venafi team requests additional requirements be met, we will work with you to determine what success looks like and do our best to provide any Tools/guidance necessary to reach certification.

## Technical Certification vs. Partner Program

The technical certification process is not to be confused with Venafi Partnership, though the two are related.
The best way to think about it would be "Packaging" vs. "Marketing".

### Packaging

The final step of the {{tlspk}} certification process will be ***Packaging*** - deciding how end users will deploy and interact with your solution.
In order for end users to discover the solution and establish a strong user base, the packaging of the solution should be polished and easy to understand.
Use of company logos, iconography, product names, marketing copy, etc. will all help users quickly identify your solution in the growing [Venafi Marketplace](https://marketplace.venafi.com).

### Marketing

***Marketing***, on the other hand, focuses on bringing attention to a fully packaged & published solution.
Once the solution has been certified and the initial Marketplace Listing has been created, the next logical step would be an official partnership with Venafi, which will also engage the Venafi Marketing team to start making some noise about the new solution available to Venafi users.
