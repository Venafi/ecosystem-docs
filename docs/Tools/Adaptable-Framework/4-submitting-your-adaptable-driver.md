# Submitting/Updating

You've written an amazing Adaptable Driver and are now ready to make it available for users of the {{midcp}}.
Or maybe you're ready to publish some bug fixes or feature enhancements to an existing solution.
Either way, that's **awesome!**

As a Venafi partner, you'll have a dedicated group in our [GitLab instance](https://coolsolutions.venafi.com) where you can [manage your own repository](./5-managing-your-repo.md).

## New Solution

If this is a new solution, please reach out to the Venafi Ecosystem team.

## Existing Solution

If this is an update to an existing solution, please submit a **Merge Request** to your [target repository](https://coolsolutions.venafi.com/ecosystem){: target="_blank" } and the update will be reviewed by the proper parties before being automatically updated on the [Venafi Marketplace](https://marketplace.venafi.com).
