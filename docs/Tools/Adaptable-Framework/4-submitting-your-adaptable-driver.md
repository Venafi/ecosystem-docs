# Submitting/Updating

You've written an amazing Adaptable Driver and are now ready to make it available for users of the {{midcp}}.
Or maybe you're ready to publish some bug fixes or feature enhancements to an existing solution. 
Either way, that's **awesome!**

In an effort to streamline code and script submissions for ecosystem solutions, Venafi has adopted [GitLab](https://coolsolutions.venafi.com) for better visibility, version control and documentation.

## New Solution

If this is a new solution, please reach out to the Venafi Ecosystem team. 

## Existing Solution

If this is an update to an existing solution, please submit a **Merge Request** and the update will be reviewed by the proper parties before being automatically updated on the [Venafi Marketplace](https://marketplace.venafi.com).
