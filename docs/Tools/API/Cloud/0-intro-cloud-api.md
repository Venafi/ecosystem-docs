## General Tips

- Ideally, certificates should be referenced using the GUID of the certificate object
- Listing all certificates in a folder could be problematic because there may be a very high number of certificates in some policy folders. A better approach would be to check (search) whether a specific certificate already exists within a given policy folder.
