# Overview: Venafi as a Service

{{ vsl }} helps you take control of your TLS/SSL certificates and eliminate outages to applications, services, and security infrastructure.

The first step is to discover and inventory all of your server certificates wherever they are found, both inside and outside of your private network.

Following discovery, {{ vs }} helps you to monitor and protect your certificates. When any certificates need your attention, you'll then be able to identify and resolve any potential problems before they lead to system outages or security breaches.
