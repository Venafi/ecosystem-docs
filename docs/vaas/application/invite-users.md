# Inviting other users to Venafi as a Service

As an administrator, you can invite other users to {{vs}}. After a new user
accepts the invitation and registers for an account, you'll see that user's name
on the User Management page and can reassign a role as needed.

!!! note "NOTE"  
    The first three users are automatically assigned the Admin role. After that, users are assigned the Resource Owner role.

    The link is valid for 10 minutes from the time it was generated until the user clicks the link to accept the invitation. If the validity period has expired, you'll need to generate a new link.

After the invited user clicks the link, an account registration page is
available to the user for sign up. Once successful, you'll see the new user's
name on the User Management list.
