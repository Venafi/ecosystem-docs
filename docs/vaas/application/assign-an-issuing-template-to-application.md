# Assigning an Issuing Template to an application

An Application owner can apply single or multiple Issuing Templates to his or
her application so that when a certificate is requested, the appropriate Issuing
Template will be used to request a certificate.

These steps assume you already have an existing application. If you need to create
a new application, see [Create an application](creating-an-application).

## To assign an Issuing Template to an application

1. In the menu bar, click **Organization** > **Applications**.

2. Select the Application to add an issuing template to.

1. Click the **Summary** tab. The Certificate Issuing Templates associated with
   this application are listed at the bottom of the page. 

1. To add a new issuing template, select a template from the **Certificate
   Issuing Templates** field, and then click **Add**.

    !!! question "What is the API Alias?"
        The **API Alias** shows up as the _Certificate use-case_ when a certificate request is issued using this application.
 
1. When you're done, click **Save**.
