# Getting started

If you're just getting started with {{vsl}}, you've come to the right place.

Protecting machine identities boils down to two primary tasks:

1. Discovering server certificates, wherever they live
1. Managing discovered server certificates to prevent outages and security breaches

So here are the best ways to get started with these essential tasks:

- Learn more about [certificate discovery](c-Cloud-discovery-service.md).
- Create your first [private](t-discovery-create-Basic-discovery.md) or [public discovery service](t-discovery-create-Enhanced-discovery.md).

- If certificates are already in your inventory, use the [Dashboard](t-cloud-predict-dashboard.md) to learn how they're doing.

- If you're a {{ vs }} administrator, [learn about {{ vs }} administration tasks](about-managing-vaas-account.md), such as adding people to your {{ vs }} account or changing a person's roles and permissions.

You can choose from three unique discovery services:

Service | Private Discovery (internal) | Public Discovery (external) | Certificate Validation | Schedulable | Premium Feature
:------------ | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: 
Basic Discovery | :heavy_check_mark: |   |   |   |
Enhanced Discovery | :heavy_check_mark: |   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark: 
Internet Discovery |   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | (:heavy_check_mark:) |    

Learn more here about which discovery service to use.

So putting first things first, we'll show you how easy it is to discover 
certificates and to quickly determine their status.

!!! tip "TIP"
      If you've already discovered your certificates, [take a look here to learn more about managing discovered certificates](t-cloud-predict-dashboard.md).

## Second, manage discovered certificates

After {{vs}} discovers your certificates, then you can quickly monitor and identify any problems that could put your machine identities at risk.

Following certificate discovery, you can view a complete inventory of all discovered certificates. Certificate validation happens automatically when you use the [Enhanced Discovery method](c-Cloud-Discovering-Private-Internal-certificates.md), but you can also [run validations manually](validating-certificates.md#running-a-validation-manually). Either way, finding risks among your certificate inventory is the most important next step to protecting your machine identities. Acting on troubled areas empowers you to prevent system outages and plug security holes. The [certificate inventory](managing-discovered-certificates.md) provides visibility into potential issues, as does the [system dashboard](t-cloud-predict-dashboard.md).
