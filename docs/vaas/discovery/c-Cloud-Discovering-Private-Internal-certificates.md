# Discover private (internal) certificates

So you're ready to search for certificates in your private network. You
can use either a Basic discovery or Enhanced discovery service to discover
server certificates within your private networks.

If you're not sure which one to use, [learn more about discovery services here](c-Cloud-discovery-service.md).

!!! tip "Before you Begin"
    During the configuration of either discovery service, you'll need access to end-points where you can install required {{vs}} components. So it can be helpful to identify ahead of time where you plan to install the components and be prepared with a command line utility during configuration.
