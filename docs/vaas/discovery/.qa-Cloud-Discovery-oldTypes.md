# What happened to *Network Discovery*?

Domain and external discovery methods (and their associated API endpoints) have 
been replaced by the all new *Discovery Services* feature.

From the new Services page, you can create three unique discovery service types to scan your 
private (internal) or public (external) networks.

See how the old discovery methods map to the new Discovery Services:

Old Discovery Methods  | New Discovery Service | Use to... | Discovery Type
:------------ | :------------- | :-------------- | :--------------
*Domain* and *External Discovery* | **Internet Discovery** | Discover and protect certificates *external* to your private network. Add domains, external FQDNs, external IP addresses or external CIDR ranges as targets for your Internet Discovery service. | Public (external)
*Internal Discovery* | **Basic Discovery** | Discover and protect certificates *internal* to your network. Run quick manual discoveries without certificate validation. Uses Venafi's Scanafi utility. | Private (internal)
| **Enhanced Discovery** | Run scheduled (optional) discoveries with automated validation. Uses Venafi's VSatellites, which you install on an internal server. | Private (internal)

## What happens to my existing Domain and External discovery configurations?

When the new Discovery Services feature is enabled on your account, {{vs}} migrates all of your existing Domain and External discovery settings to the new, default Internet Discovery service.

## What happens to my existing Internal discovery configurations?

When the new Discovery Services feature is enabled on your account, {{vs}} migrates all of your existing Internal discovery settings to a single Basic Discovery service.
