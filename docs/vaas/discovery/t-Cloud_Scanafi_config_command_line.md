# Configure and copy Scanafi command line

Scanafi is a command-line based utility. Options that dictate the operating mode, network segments where certificate discovery is performed, and scan parameters are specified in a configuration JSON file when the program is called from the command line. The configuration JSON file parameters are the same regardless of the version (Windows, Linux, MacOS) being run.

    !!! note "NOTE"
        We recommend running Scanafi as a service using a Cron job for Linux or MacOS and Windows Scheduled Task for Windows. At a minimum, run a scan every 7 days or more frequently if desired. Using sophisticated reconciliation processes and to eliminate duplicates, VaaS will reconcile multiple discoveries of the same certificate instances so that you donâ€™t have to.
