# Defining recommended settings for an Issuing Template

Recommended Settings allow you to provide guidance to your {{rolesRO}}s when
they create certificate requests using a particular Issuing Template. This helps
eliminate guess work and saves time by providing the settings ahead of time.

!!! info
    Recommended settings are just that -- recommendations. If you want to
    _require_ a specific value or set of values that {{rolesRO}} must use for
    certificate requests, use issuing rules instead. 

!!! important "Important"
    You must be a {{rolesSA}} or {{rolesPKI}} to do this.

## To add recommended settings for an issuing template

1. In the menu bar, click **Settings > Issuing Templates**.

1. Click **New** if you're creating a new issuing template,

    OR

    In the template list, click the name of the template to which you want to add recommended settings.

1. In the Recommended Settings columns on the right, click **Modify**.

2. Fill out each field with settings recommended for the issuing template.

3. When you're done, click **Save**.

    The Issuing Template reflects the settings you defined.
