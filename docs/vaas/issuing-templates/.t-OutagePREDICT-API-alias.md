# How to use the API Alias

An API Alias is useful because Certificate Issuing Templates can be renamed and without an alias, the scope of breakage would be every application where that Issuing Template is assigned. 

Having API Aliases helps eliminate confusion because different roles: 

    - create Issuing Templates (PKI Administator) 
    - use those Issuing Templates in Applications (Resource Owner)

The **API Alias** is only relevant to API callers, specifically those who are invoking the 

        GET /outagedetection/v1/applications/{appName}/certificateissuingtemplates/{citAlias} 

method to get certificate policy details from the Issuing Template that is assigned to the application.  

The API Alias allows movement away from cumbersome GUID zone IDs like: 

        857b1e54-ec75-42be-81d7-ee1de1b18508 
        
to the user friendly *AppName\CitAlias* zone IDs like *My Application\My CIT*.
 
 
The API Alias defaults to the name of the Certificate Issuing Template when the CIT is first assigned to the Application.

    You can change the API Alias later but be careful because changing the alias might break any API-integrated applications if the application is using it.
