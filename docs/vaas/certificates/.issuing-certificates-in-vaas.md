# Issuing new certificates in Venafi as a Service

Follow these steps to configure {{vs}} to issue new certificates. If you already have one or more of these steps complete, just jump ahead to the steps you haven't yet completed yet.

<div markdown="1" class="step-container">

1. Create a ***certificate authority***

    A certificate authority (CA) is required in order for new certificate requests to be signed. {{vs}} supports both internal and external CAs.

    [Get started](adding-a-certificate-authority.md)

2. Add the certificate authority to a ***certificate issuing template***

    Certificate authorities are assigned to one or more certificate issuing templates. The template also allows you to require or recommend specific values on the certificate request.

    [Get started](certificate-issuing-templates.md)

3. Reference the certificate issuing template from an ***application***

    You can now reference the template in one or more applications in {{vs}}. 

    [Get started](creating-an-application.md)

4. Submit a ***certificate request***

    When you submit a certificate request, you'll be asked to select an application that the certificate will be used for.
