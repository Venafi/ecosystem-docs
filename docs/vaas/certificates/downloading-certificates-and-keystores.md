# Downloading certificates, certificate chains, and keystores

You can download both certificates and keystores from {{vs}} after a certificate has been issued. This can
be done using the {{vs}} or via the API.

!!! note "Downloading a keystore"
    Keystore download is available only when the key pair was generated by Venafi. 

For information on using the API, see [Downloading a certificate](downloading-a-certificate.md). 

<!-- Need to add a link to downloading a keystore when that API is ready -->
