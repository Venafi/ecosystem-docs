# Set up email notifications

Email notifications to help you track the status of your certificates and
installations and alert you to any risks that need attention. The notification
emails give you a consistent and steady view into the status of your environment
without having to sign in to {{ vs }}. 

If you are Premium subscriber, you can specify specify additional email
addresses that the reports should be forwarded to. Even users who aren't
registered for {{ vs }} can have their email addresses added to the
distribution.

Two reports are available:

## Machine Identity Digest (Premium Feature)

This report summarizes certificate and installation activity. It  highlights potential 
risks that you should be aware of so that you can resolve these issues.

## Applications Certificate Expiration

This report shows expiring certificates assigned to the
[applications](creating-an-application.md) of the signed-in user.  This report
is application-focused rather than certificate-focused.

Premium subscribers can add additional recipients. The additional recipients will 
receive the same report as the signed-in user that configured the notification.

!!! example
    A user with User ID `maria@company.com` signs in to {{ vs }} and enables this notification.
    She then adds User ID `jose@company.com` as a recipient. When {{ vs }} sends the email, `jose@company.com` 
    will receive the report that shows the status of `maria@company.com`'s applications.
