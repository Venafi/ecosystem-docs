# Finding logged data through filtering

The Event Log shows a list of all events logged as a result of either user actions or {{vs}} operational activities.

You can select and combine pre-built filters to quickly filter out logged events that don't match your filter criteria. For example, you could enter a specific user name to see all events that include that user within the event text. Or you could enter the search term *login* to filter the list down to only those items that include "login".

But you can also filter the list by using one or more pre-built filters.

## To filter event logs using pre-built filters

1. In {{vs}}, click **Settings** > **Event Logs**.
1. Click +, and then select one or more filters from the list.
1. Click each filter's drop-down list to select one or more sub-filters.
1. After you've added the filters you need, click **Apply Filter**.
