# About Venafi as a Service Teams

{{vs}} lets you organize your users into teams. A {{vs}} *Team* is a collection
of users with one or more team owners and an associated {{vs}} role that's
assigned to all members of the team.

You can assign teams as owners of specific applications, which gives team
members access to those applications.

Team memberships can be managed manually, or, if you've enabled SSO, they can be
managed automatically.

The {{vs}} Teams feature offers several key benefits, including the following:

* Helps prevent system outages caused by orphaned applications or OUs; orphaned
  objects can occur when a user assigned to them leaves {{vs}}

* Applications and OUs assigned to teams are more easily managed since all
  members of a given team have access and visibility into them

* Makes on-boarding of new users easier when you assign them to a team that has
  access to specific resources

* Assigning roles to members of a team is much simpler and easier to manage than
  assigning roles to many individual users

## Best practices for creating and managing teams

Creating teams and adding team members is easy. But before you start creating
teams, consider the following:

* Who do you want to add as team owners?

* Who do you want to add as team members?

* What role do you plan to assign to your team so that team members can do their
  work most effectively?

* Enable single sign-on (SSO) within your {{vs}} account so that users can be
  added to Teams automatically based on their group assignments, role
  assignments, etc. within your SSO solution.
