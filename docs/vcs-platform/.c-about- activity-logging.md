# About activity logging

Activity logging creates an audit trail for identifying unusual activity. 


Audit trail - users did something
Want to find abnormal behavior
Security related
Generally consumed by security-focused staff for the end users of the system
Event notification - something interesting in the system the end user would want to know about
Something is happening - changing state, failing
Generally consumed by end users of the system
Most SaaS users are already familiar with the second two above and the terminology
What is consumed by the user and how? What is the model?
Events have a common set of attributes that describe it and capture all the info
ID, source, target, type (payload type?), subject (additional context), others (action, etc)
You have resources with actions that are happening to/on them
Events are emitted by various parts of the system when actions occur on resources
These can be subscribed to in some way
There is some way that these are delivered to subscribers (e.g. webhook, UI, e-mail) - how the subscriber can receive the events
How do audits fit into this model? An event is emitted for them as with anything else
We need to refine or homogenize what we have today since it is too limited - it includes more attributes and is stored more generically
Formalize the definition of event (how structured, with what properties) and make it more amenable to subscription 
Identify required means of delivery/presentation
Enabler is implementing the Cloud infrastructure to do this
Who will define the events to be captured?
Establish a foundational framework for event publishing for all products written on top of the platform - to be used by all the developers (including Platform)
