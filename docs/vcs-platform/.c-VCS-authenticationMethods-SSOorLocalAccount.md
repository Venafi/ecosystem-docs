# Local user account logins and SSO

{{ vs }} administrators can selectively control which users are allowed to use local accounts for logging in. If you're a {{ vs }} administrator, you can view and edit user accounts and either enable or disable the local account sign-in option.

!!! tip
    The primary purpose for allowing local accounts is for situations when your SSO goes offline—either intentionally or due to an outage of your SSO service—and an alternate authentication method is required.

    As a matter of tightening security, using a local account to sign in to {{vs}} should be reserved for use by authorized administrators only in cases where SSO isn't available.

## Where can I find this setting?
