# Setting my local Venafi as a Service account password

If an administrator has enabled SSO and then also enabled local account login for 
your {{vsl}}&#8482; account, you'll need  to set your account password if you want 
to log in using your local account.

Local accounts are typically enabled only for administrators and can only be enabled 
or disabled by administrators. This feature is designed as an enhanced security option.

!!! tip
    If you are an administrator and want to know how to enable local account logins for other administrators, see [Local user account logins and SSO](c-VCS-authenticationMethods-SSOorLocalAccount.md) and [Enabling or disabling a user's local account login](enabling-disabling-local-account-login.md).

Before you can complete the following procedure, an administrator must first enable 
local account login on your user account. If you feel you need local account login 
access in addition to SSO, please contact your {{vs}} administrator.
