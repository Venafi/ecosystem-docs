# Getting Started: Cloud WAF

If you've made it here, you should already have a general understanding about [Cloud WAFs and how they use {{mids}}](1-overview-cloud-waf.md) and you're ready to get started developing your solution.

## High-level Process

1. Create a [TLS Protect Cloud](https://vaas.venafi.com){: target="_blank" } account if you don't have one already.
2. Decide on a programming language and understand what tooling, if any, your solution will use (If you aren't sure yet, [this](https://venafi-dev-onboarding.paperform.co/){: target="_blank" } might help ðŸ™‚).
3. Start building!
4. Perform [functional testing](3-functional-testing-cloud-waf.md).
5. Get [certified](../../Certification/TLS-Protect-Cloud/1-tlsp-certification-intro.md)!
