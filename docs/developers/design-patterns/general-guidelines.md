# General Guidelines & Best Practices

The following guidelines apply generically to all integrations to Venafi, regardless of integration type, and should be referenced as the integration is developed & tested, and as new features or enhancements are added.

## Naming Conventions

A standard naming convention should be adopted to avoid any collisions when objects (applications, certificates, devices, etc.) are created. Collisions can occur when the name you define already exists in Venafi. You can use the same prefix or suffix, and then add something unique to the name.
