# API Setup
During {{vs}} API setup, you to need to do the following activities:

* Review our {% include 'sn-Cloud-api-LinktoSwagger.md' %}. The online
  documentation describes the interface, REST API functions, and corresponding
  parameters.

* Set up an email account or alias for the API user. The API user account, along
  with an API key, allows programmatic access to VaaS data. 

* Use the Web interfaces to obtain the API key for subsequent REST API calls.
