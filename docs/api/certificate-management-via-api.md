# Certificate management via the API

This section shows you basic information about how to programmatically request
and manage certificates that are in {{vs}}. 

{{vs}} uses Issuing Templates to allow administrators to specify the conditions
that certificate requests must meet in order for the system to issue the
certificate. Certificate issuing templates, which are associated with
Applications, are used to evaluate submitted certificate requests as well as
determine which CA account to use to issue a certificate.

You can use the {{vs}} UI to manage [Issuing Templates](certificate-issuing-templates.md).
