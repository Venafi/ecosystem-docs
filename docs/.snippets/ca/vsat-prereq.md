**{{vsat}}**

All ACMEv2 CAs require a
[{{vsat}}](../../../vsatellite/c-VSatellite-Management-about.md). If you already
have a {{vsat}} installed, it will be available for you to select during
configuration. 

If not, you'll be able to set up a {{vsat}} during configuration. Just be sure
to have a machine ready that meets the [system
requirements](../../../vsatellite/t-VSatellite-deployNew.md) before you start.
