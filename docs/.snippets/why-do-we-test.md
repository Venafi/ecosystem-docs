- To find bugs before the customer does!
- To perform continuous testing and fixing so that TPP is "shippable" at shorter intervals, following "quality at speed" best practices. Specifically,
    - Automating customer-like test data and test environment provisioning.
    - Running all test levels in all branches at more frequent intervals in the pipeline to find bugs faster.
    - Providing immediate feedback loops on test issues in developer tools.
    - Quickly responding to failures and quickly fixing them.
    - Maintaining a stable mainline as seen through test pass/fail trends.
- Decoupling the release and release trains so that TPP is "shippable" at shorter intervals, following continuous testing and delivery best practices. Specifically, to eliminate the 2-week regression cycle at the end of every TPP release.
