??? danger "Outages"

    Workloads can become unavailable for many reasons and any such event can be described as an **outage**.

    When you choose to secure your workloads, you introduce an additional failure point, specifically the {{mid}} itself.
    This is because {{mids}} are designed to expire after some predefined duration.
    When {{mids}} expire they stop working and the workloads they protect become unavailable.
    A likely outcome of failing to mitigate against outages is negative impact to brand reputation and lost revenue.

    Automation using the {{midcp}} is a key defense against outages.
