??? question "What is functional testing?"

    **To summarize [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing){: target="_blank"}:**

    Functional testing is a QA process that sees a "tester" run through all documented functionality of a product or, in this case, an integrated solution.
    It's a great way to uncover bugs, unexpected behaviors and documentation errors.
