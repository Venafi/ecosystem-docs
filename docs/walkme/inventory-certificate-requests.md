# Certificate requests

Use this page to monitor who is requesting certificates. You can identify your power users and see who is stuck and might need help. 

Certificate requests default to Pending or Failed, but you can clear the filters to see all requests.

Use filters to analyze by requestor, request status, issuing template or application. [Learn more ![Weblink](../img/ico-weblink.gif)](../vaas/certificates/using-filters-to-find-certificates.md){:target="_blank"}
