# Using the Vault Venafi Secrets Engine integration

Certificates are requested from the Vault integration using the standard Vault REST APIs for certificate keypair generation and issuance *(/venafi-pki/issue* or */venafi-pki/sign*) or via the Vault command line utility 

            (vault write venafi-pki/issue/cloud common-name=www.venafi.localhost) 
            
where 'venafi-pki' refers to the role that was created to use the Venafi PKIÂ secrets engine.

Use the appropriate method (vault command line utility or Vault REST API) based on your situation.
