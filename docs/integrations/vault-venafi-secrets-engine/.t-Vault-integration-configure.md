# Configuring the Vault Venafi Secrets Engine integration

The Venafi Vault plug-in accepts additional arguments to the Vault write command to specify the Zone and the API key that the integration will use to communicate with {{vs}}.

Here is an example Vault write command to set up a role with a specified API key and zone along with Venafi-recommended default values to store certificate private keys:

        
        vault write venafi-pki/roles/cloud cloud_url= zone="Default" apikey=xxxxx-xxxx-
        xxxx-xxxxxx generate_lease=true store_by_cn="true" store_pkey="true"
        store_by_serial="true" ttl=1h max_ttl=1h

* Use **Your Parameters** on the Automation page to determine which zone should be used to issue certificates.

!!! note "Note"
    **Your Parameters** displays the policies that must be conformed to when  certificates are requested from the zone. 
    Additional information andÂ examples of setting up the issuer with {{vs}} and other Venafi solutions can be found in [Venafi's Github page](https://github.com/Venafi).
