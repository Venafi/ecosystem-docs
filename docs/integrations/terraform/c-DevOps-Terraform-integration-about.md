# About Terraform integration with Venafi as a Service

![overview of Terraform integration](Condor_overview_Terraform.png)

The Venafi Terraform Provider is a custom provider that wraps the Venafi GoVCert
library. This library is a lightweight library that performs key generation and
interfaces with REST APIs provided by various Venafi products. The provider can
be referenced via Terraform plans as with any other provider.

The Venafi Terraform Provider allows Terraform users to seamlessly incorporate
certificate management into Terraform plans when orchestrating services.
