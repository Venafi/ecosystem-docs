# Using the Kubernetes integration

The cert-manager plug-in creates certificates automatically when certificate resources are created in Kubernetes or when Ingress controllers are annotated with TLS annotations.

Here is an example of a certificate resource file that requests a certificate from {{vs}} using the issuer that was previously created:

        apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Certificate
        metadata:
          name: example-venafi-localhost
          namespace: cert-manager-example
        spec:
            secretName: cert4-venafi-localhost
            IssuerRef:
                name: cloud-devops-issuer
            commonName: example.venafi.localhost

The kubectl command can then be used to create a certificate resource, assuming that the certificate resource file is saved as a file named *cert.yaml*:
        
        $kubectl create -f cert2.yaml

For ingress controllers, the issuer is configured as an annotation. If the TLS annotation is specified, the cert-manager plug-in will request a certificate that contains the domain name listed in the hosts and store the certificate and private key in the Kubernetes secret identified by ‘secretName’.

Here’s an example ingress resource file:

        

        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
            name: hello-ingress
            annotations:
                certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: “cloud-devops-issuer”
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true"
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: error_log 
        /var/log/nginx/apperror.log debug;
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: access_log  /var/log/nginx/appaccess.log upstreaminfo if=$loggable;
        spec:
            tls:
                - secretName: hellodemo-venafi-localhost
                  hosts:
                   - hellodemo.venafi.localhost
            rules:
                - host: hellodemo.venafi.localhost
                  http:
                    paths:
                    - path: /
                    backend:
                        serviceName: hello-node
                        servicePort: 8080
