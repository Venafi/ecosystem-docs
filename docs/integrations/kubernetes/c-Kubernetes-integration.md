# Kubernetes Cert-Manager's integration with Venafi as a Service

![Kubernetes flow diagram](Kubernetes_flow_diagram.png)

The Venafi Kubernetes Cert-Manager integration is implemented as a plug-in to
the JetStack Cert-Manager project.

The integration's set up instructions can be found here.

The integration is implemented as an additional cert-manager issuer. The Venafi
issuer is configured with the zone that will be used to issue certificates as
well as the API key to authenticate to {{vs}}.

Multiple issuers can be configured to support use cases where different
certificate types are required for different use cases, such as:

* Issuing certificates to Ingress controllers that contain TLS annotations to
  enable TLS for inbound traffic to your Kubernetes cluster
* Creating certificates as Kubernetes secrets for use by pods in a Kubernetes
  cluster to secure communication between pods with TLS

You can support issuing certificates for test and production instances from your
{{vs}} account by creating multiple issuers and associating them with
different zones.

!!! note "Note"  
    Once the Venafi Issuer is created, any certificates that are generated by
    cert-manager will be issued from {{vs}}.
