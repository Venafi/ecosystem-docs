# Installing the Kubernetes integration

Venafi has provided a fully functional demo environment for installing and using the integration that will automatically:

* deploy a cert-manager instance in your Kubernetes cluster
* configure a Venafi issuer
* create a demo Kubernetes Ingress controller.

!!! BP "Best Practice"  
    Venafi recommends deploying the demo environment to test the integration first. The Quickstart guide README describes the steps needed to deploy the demo environment using an included makefile to set up all the demo components in a single step.

The integration can also be installed as a standalone component using *helm*.
